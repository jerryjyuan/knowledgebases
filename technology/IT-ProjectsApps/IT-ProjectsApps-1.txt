	AWS
	...
	
	I am really good at mixed/combined/grandmastercombined/.../overall-balanced/...

		==>yes, you are able to do dev, it doesn't you have to be in dev team, ...
		==>right, but I can be in dev team sometimes, ...
		==>oh, Rama in Worldpay said: maybe not
		==>en, at that time at Worldpay, it was not due to Rama and Rama's words, ...
			==>I remembered I spoke really loud during one main PM meeting, ..., especially about Jade as well, but for sure
			   this was not the main scenario, but complicated aspects, not really about Rama or SOAP Apps, etc.
			==>
			Sometimes I can be overall-balanced, and sometimes, I can do some dev, like CoreLogic, ...,
				or even 2 job work, ..., ...

How to know it is unix and dos formats?
	==>Rerun the command: size stays the same
	+ 162 bytes: from unix -> dos: cr: 1 byte: 158 lines: close
	
	=>If running dos format: complain about '\r'
	
	
	Why looking differently?

	Root causes:
		1) Deployment: cause the file got corrupted? No: it was the old file, but why is this file?
		2) 



TDD:
	==>Useful principle(s)
	==>Practical Guides/Ways:
		==>Need to enable some methodologies...
		==>Depends...
		==>...
		
		==>Angular: how to enable practical guides?
		
		==>
		
		==>1) Percentage based: how much percentages are used for TDD in different apps and domains and technologies?
		
		==>2) Apps Based
		
		==>3) Technology Based
		
		==>...

	==>Scenarios:
		==>TDD
		==>Testing: it is important: but not necessarily the same as Tom Nolan's TDD
			==>Testing is a common terminology and a set of procedures
			==>Even without TDD, testing itself is always important and needed as part of dev processes
		==>...
		
	==>Overall: Jerry does and will do: "overall-balanced" ways regarding TDD/BDD, and plus more good testing scenarios
