##UI Design:

1. UI Design:
	Examples:
		https://dev.to/nghiemthu/build-a-modern-website-from-scratch-full-tutorial-1-hour-free-1io
		
	==>Level 0a: Starter: Design + Images + ...
				 ==>Starter: can be fixed templates, or customized ones for specific UI apps, or dynamic enabled ones
				 1) Fixed templates: some website companies have fixed templates/starters
				 2) Starter include:
				 	==>Figma design: has the sections and also related images scenarios
				 	==>Figma design: also has primary colors, etc. (from site look and feel design)
				 	images/favicons/avatars: many images should be pre-enabled before working on coding: this saves time and interruptions when coding
				 	core html templates/fixed-sections
	==>Level 0b: Page-Level + Responsiveness + ...
	Work on section by section:
		1) Method 1: Starting from HTML5 tags: such as: <section></section>
		2) Method 2: Complete one section: comment it out, then work on next section
		3) Method 3: Inside each section: Work on text/image/etc first =>Create CSS class names for each section/div/element, then create CSS classes for these elements
					 Each field should have its own CSS class name (can utilize global var css names for common or primary values)
					 CSS file should have global / common CSS var for global values/css variables
		4) Method 4: For elements/fields, group related fields into: div div-header, div-details, etc.
		5) Method 5: When adding CSS classes, incorporate responsive design into css: utilize @media for various viewports/widths: one 1fr, two 1fr, three 1fr, etc.
					 display: grid
					 grid-fixed-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
		6) Method 6: After testing the page, check cross-browser compatibility with other browsers
	==>Level 1: Section
	==>Level 2: Container/box/sub-section:
					==>Width: can reduce using width: xxxpx instead of 100%
	==>Level 3: Data elements/Fields
	==>Level 4: Added Effects/Features: Animations, Transitions, etc
				Animations:
					Navigation With Transition
						hover: before/after
						fill: ...
						transition: fill... 
					...
					gradient...
					border-radius + box-shadow + ...
					<script> window.onscroll= ()=> {}</script>
				Added Data Complexities: Date input Safari, Default Date input value
				Data Validations and Constraints
	VSC: button.xxx + right pane display (maybe another display window aligned up) + autocomplete/code-assist
	Google icons w3schools
		https://www.w3schools.com/icons/google_icons_intro.asp
	Google Fonts:
