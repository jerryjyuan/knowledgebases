		But: npm update - maybe useful:
			C:\Users\jerry\wksp\fundraiser-ui-apps\src\main\ng>npm update -h
			npm update [-g] [<pkg>...]
			aliases: up, upgrade, udpate
		
npm list

	C:\Users\jerry\wksp\fundraiser-ui-apps\src\main\ng>npm list @angular/cli
	gmccheck-uiapp@0.0.0 C:\Users\jerry\wksp\fundraiser-ui-apps\src\main\ng
