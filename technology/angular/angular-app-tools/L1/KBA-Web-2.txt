What is a GUID?
GUID (aka UUID) is an acronym for 'Globally Unique Identifier' (or 'Universally Unique Identifier'). It is a 128-bit integer number used to identify resources. The term GUID is generally used by developers working with Microsoft technologies, while UUID is used everywhere else.

How unique is a GUID?
128-bits is big enough and the generation algorithm is unique enough that if 1,000,000,000 GUIDs per second were generated for 1 year the probability of a duplicate would be only 50%. Or if every human on Earth generated 600,000,000 GUIDs there would only be a 50% probability of a duplicate.

How are GUIDs used?
GUIDs are used in enterprise software development in C#, Java, and C++ as database keys, component identifiers, or just about anywhere else a truly unique identifier is required. GUIDs are also used to identify all interfaces and objects in COM programming.

2. 	Angular/NodeJS/NPM Commands:
		==>node <command>: node is on path
		==>npm <command>: npm is on path
		==>ng <command>: ng is on path
		==>Enabled by package.json:
			npm run/run-script/rum/urn <script-command>
			==>They will look up the script names in package.json:
			    "scripts": {
			        "ng": "ng",
			        "start": "ng serve --open",	==>same as: npm start: because start is one default command of NPM
			        "build": "ng build",
			        "test": "ng test",			==>same as: npm start: because test is one default command of NPM
			        "lint": "ng lint",
			        "e2e": "ng e2e"
			    }    
			    
			C:\Users\jerry\wksp\angular\angular-10-registration-login-example-master>npm run
			Lifecycle scripts included in angular-registration-login-example:
			  start
			    ng serve --open
			  test
			    ng test
			
			available via `npm run-script`: only available via package.json enablement: so need to run: npm run ng/...
			  ng
			    ng
			  build
			    ng build
			  lint
			    ng lint
			  e2e
			    ng e2e
