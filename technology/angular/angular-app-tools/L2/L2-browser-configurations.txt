IE:
	mode
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/ie-mode/
		F12 Developer Tool: can tune mode level
		1) Your own control of IE: you can set it up as default
		2) Company installed/controlled/configured IE: the default level is fixed: like 5, so you cannot permanently set it up
			==>But you can set up temporary browser sessions with the mode level
			==>You may need to keep the F12 developer tool window open in order to keep mode settings effective
			==>Different mode levels: may have different settings scenarios
			Mode 11: not working completely with SiteScope: with some main screen display issues
			Mode 10: working fine with SiteScope
			Default Mode 5: not displaying the menus well
				==>Actually it works for the main functions - except the above menu display issues
				==>The menu items still work - but display is not good enough - but mode 10 may help with the display
				==>This is ok because most of the users will not do analysis like Jerry does
					but their mode=5 IE should work like this - maybe they feel weird - or Jerry's IE was abused specifically
			==>If closing the F12 tool screen, it is back to mode 5 as the default
