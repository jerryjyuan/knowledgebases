Browsers:
	==>Website Urls: case sensitivity:
		==>1) Normally: the main domain names/addresses: case insensitive
						==>Either due to W3C's default or normal settings or standards
						==>Or: each domain owners registered case insensitive addresses
		==>2) But sub-domain part, app-context, war-context-root, servlet name, etc.
						==>Can be case sensitive - depending upon how the application or company configurations
						==>Especially servlet name: could be case sensitive by web.xml
						==>query strings, parameters: could be depending how servlet or RESTful APIs parse/validate them
	==>Browser: can utilize the entire free space of Disk C as storage space: such as 303GB

		Chrome -> Dev Tool -> Application -> Storage

	==>Manage AppData:
		==>Generally no need or not recommend to delete AppData folder(s) and data:
			==>Because there may be some or more configuration data in addition to cached or pure data
			==>So some apps are dependent upon some their configurations there, or your own customization configurations as well
		==>If need to clean up AppData:
			1) Use each browser to do deletion or cleanup
			2) Use each app to do uninstall, or deleation, or their cleanup tools

IE:
	mode

		F12 Developer Tool: can tune mode level
		1) Your own control of IE: you can set it up as default
		2) Company installed/controlled/configured IE: the default level is fixed: like 5, so you cannot permanently set it up
			==>But you can set up temporary browser sessions with the mode level
			==>You may need to keep the F12 developer tool window open in order to keep mode settings effective
			==>Different mode levels: may have different settings scenarios
			Mode 11: not working completely with SiteScope: with some main screen display issues
			Mode 10: working fine with SiteScope
			Default Mode 5: not displaying the menus well
				==>Actually it works for the main functions - except the above menu display issues
				==>The menu items still work - but display is not good enough - but mode 10 may help with the display
				==>This is ok because most of the users will not do analysis like Jerry does
					but their mode=5 IE should work like this - maybe they feel weird - or Jerry's IE was abused specifically
			==>If closing the F12 tool screen, it is back to mode 5 as the default
