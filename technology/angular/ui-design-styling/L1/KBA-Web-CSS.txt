	https://vsellis.com/understanding-dpi-resolution-and-print-vs-web-images/#:~:text=DPI%3A%20Dot's%20per%20inch.,density%20of%20a%20digital%20image.
	Resolution:
		Resolution is the measure of pixels in the display, usually expressed in measurements of width x height. For example a monitor that is 1920 x 1080 is 1920 pixels across and 1080 pixels down.
		A monitor set to 1024 x 768 will show a 1024 pixel wide by 800-pixel tall image as a full-screen image
		digital camera with higher megapixels takes better pictures than one with lower (lenses and other factors being equal) because it gives you more resolution to capture more detail
		1366x768 ==>Mean pixels on the screen
		...
		800x600
	PPI:
		Pixels per inch. Most commonly used to describe the pixel density of a screen (computer monitor, smartphone, etc…) but can also refer to the pixel density of a digital image
		19" monitor set to 1024×768 will show 70ppi (pixels per inch)
		19" monitor set to 1280×1024 will have a resolution of 87ppi which means you fit more on the screen and get more detail, but everything looks smaller
	DPI:
		Dot’s per inch. The number of dots in a printed inch. The more dot’s the higher the quality of the print (more sharpness and detail)
		Higher DPI means higher resolution
		DPI doesn’t equate to digital it’s a print measure (300dpi is standard, sometimes 150 is acceptable but never lower)
		Image Files:
			image files with higher resolution (more dpi) will also have a bigger file size because they contain more data.
			300dpi to 72dpi: same image quality with 1/4 size ==>But going into same width/heighth: less dots so less quality/resolution
		Monitor:
			DPI of a computer screen?
				72dpi is standard for the web
				Dpi, which refers to dots per inch, is a key concept to using computer graphics. Your PC doubtlessly uses a resolution of 96 dpi on the monitor.
		Printer:
			300 dpi mean?
				Print resolution is measured in dots per inch (or “DPI”) which means the number of dots of ink per inch that a printer deposits on a piece of paper. So, 300 DPI means that a printer will output 300 tiny dots of ink to fill every inch of the print. 300 DPI is the standard print resolution for high resolution output.
			600x600 DPI has 600 dots per inch in both directions. In a 1-bit system (black or white) 600x600 DPI os very good quality. For a full color system, 600x600 DPI is mediocre.
			4800x1200 DPI?
				Print Quality: The print quality is determined by the DPI (dots per inch). Most printers come with either 1200 by 1200 DPI, 2400 by 1200 DPI. 1200 X 1200 means in one square inch, there are 1200 dots across (width) and 1200 dots down (length). Some new printers boast 4800 X 1200 DPI.
