==>Can each of the MD components be styled using its exact name?

		2) Reason 2: default css selector: only has small styling, so your additions enrich them
					 Example 1: .mat-card-title{font-size:24px;font-weight:500}.mat-card-header .mat-card-title{font-size:20px}
					 			==>You can add more to enrich it...
		3) If you are unsure, check the default theme file to see if the selector is inside the file
		4) This styling way makes it very simpler

		JSON doesn't support comments by design
		We use the underscore as a convention to differentiate comments from the rest of data
		"__comment": "This is a comment!",
		{
		    "//a": "This is the first comment.",
		    "//b": "This is the second second." 
		}
		{
		    "Comments": [
		        "First comment,",
		        "Second comment"
		    ]
		}	
		Adding Comments in JSON with External Tools
		JSON5 Supports Comments
