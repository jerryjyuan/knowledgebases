==>Refer to the  official doc:
	https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries#publishing-your-library
==>Highlights:
	==>publishing your libraries using the View Engine compiler ensures that they can be transparently consumed by both View Engine and Ivy apps
==>When you install a library package, the mapping is in the node_modules folder. When you build your own library, it has to find the mapping in your tsconfig paths.
==>Generating a library with the Angular CLI automatically adds its path to the tsconfig file.
==>You can rebuild your library whenever you make changes to it, but this extra step takes time. Incremental builds functionality improves the library-development experience. Every time a file is changed a partial build is performed that emits the amended files.
==>Incremental builds can be run as a background process in your dev environment.
	ng build lib --watch
==>The build system for apps, @angular-devkit/build-angular, is based on webpack
==>The build system for libraries is based on ng-packagr
