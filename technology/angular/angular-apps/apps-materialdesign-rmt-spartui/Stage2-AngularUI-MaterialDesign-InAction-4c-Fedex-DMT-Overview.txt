Fedex: DMT tool:
	==>2019/09:
	
==>Angular: 1.x: 2010
==>Angular: 2.x: 2016/09

DMT:
	==>1) A real Angular app that I started delving into very much'
	
	==>Stages: 2-3 weeks stages for DMT UI team:
		==>2 Angular developers in India
		==>1 Tester in India
	
	==>App:
		==>Login: not integrated: due to security architectures ongoing + DMT has 4 sub-teams so it belongs to DMT architectures and overall guys work
		==>Use: maven-frontend-plugin: work together with Spring Boot
		==>Added AngularCLI
		
	==>My Work:
		==>EnvSetup: OK: the apps are running and I was able to check out/in the code...
		==>I was able to run maven-frontend-plugin app and also AngularCLI ng serve...
		==>I understood DMT and Dock Configurations as well (I even toured Fedex facility)
		==>Issues:
			==>No enough hours...
			==>Mixed tasks: architectures work + DMT-1 work
				==>Architecture Work: DMT importer/exporter: servers and shell scripts:
							==>I actually finished some modules for importer and exporter:
								import the Dock config data from many servers and add them to DB for developers to use for testing and dev processes
				==>DB
				==>DMT-1:	I chimed into UI Angular work: assigned by myself into it
							==>base: missed and didn't pay attention to: so AngularCLI didn't start up right:
									 ==>But they didn't add "base" right - I just didn't pay attention to it
							==>Component Impl:
									 ==>Add some components
							==>Dialog Windows:
									 ==>Showed some dialog windows: but not completely matching the UI wireframes from Diana as Agile/ProductManager
		==>I made some progress on DMT work because Nationwide work was easy and Syed was easy on me too...
			I did focus on DMT work quite a bit at that time, ...
			But...
