FM: RMT - UI - Angular:
	==>Natures:
		==>Nature 1:	The largest Angular UI app that Jerry has worked on
		==>Nature 2:	FM hired some good Angular developers:
						(Fanny Mae and FM: utlized any advantages of housing markets or real estates?
							==>Utilization: Governmental backbones: they both did and do: top 2 national governmental sponsored housing loan tycoons
							==>Utilization: Money creates money:	they both did and do: real estates and loan businesses: belong to: money creating money areas
							==>Utilization: Real Estate bubbles or cycles? - maybe not for sure:
											==>Sometimes: they were in some tough situations due to housing market uprising: like 2005-2007
											==>Are foreclosures/refinance benefiting/jeapardizing the small banks' loans and/or FMae/FMac? Depends
							==>Utilization: Ripping off house owners or ...? If existing/any, then not directly by them - at most by small banks' loans
											==>Are foreclosures/refinance benefiting/jeapardizing the small banks' loans and/or FMae/FMac? Depends
							==>...
		==>Nature 3:	Angular 4
		==>Nature 4:	AngularCLI: 1.7 ==>it is ok - because we use: maven to do the builds + AngularCLI versions are not directly related to Angular versions?
						==>12/17/2017: Contractors team worked on the app: started the initial work: 2 developers (plus some UI...) worked on it: e.g.: pipeline.components.ts
										==>Total team developers: 4-6 guys
						==>1/25/2018:	Contractors team worked on the app: 300 code line
						==>3/12/2018:	Contractors team worked on the app: 500 code line
						==>4/10/2018:	Contractors team worked on the app: 600 code line
						==>6/12/2018:	Contractors team worked on the app: 740 code line: he finished his 6-month work
										==>3-6 months: this app was delivered to PROD...
						==>03/29/2019:	Contractors team worked on the app: ~740 code line: the 2nd developer finished his 16-month work
						==>No more code changes: does a dev team still exist?
		==>Nature 5:	Look and Feel: should be coming from product manager and business analysts' wireframes or mockup, or prototype
						==>Based on MSS, but use deep-blue
						==>
						
		
	==>Challenges:
		==>Application Size
		==>Business Logic
		==>

Topic:	Application:

=>Build:
	maven: similar for both local and OC container

=>front-maven-plugin: 	install node/npm + npm install:
						==>This is similar to mvnw, or gradlew: wrapper of the versions
						==>So you can control how the apps are built with versions
=>exec-maven-plugin:	prod/openshift:
							ng build --prod
						local:
							ng build
==>pom.xml:
	==>Generate a war file:
		==>But use war plugin to do configurations of web.xml contents to webapp instead of normal webapp module way
	==>how to package ngapp contents:
		==>ng build: generate /dist folder... - but where /dist folder goes? - manually deployed or packaged into weblogic war file?



==>Design:
	Shared
	Dashboard
	Inventory


==>Utilization of Angular Open Source Libraries:
	==>Bootstrap CSS/JS
	==>Material Design???
	==>RxJS

==>ngx-bootstrap:	RMT-UI:
							==>AngularCLI: not in use: pure maven builds: so no angular.json ==>also no: Way 1: method 1 and method 2; ==>Also no way 2: import into style.css
							==>No Way 3
							==>Pure Way 4:
								==>>Use 1:	app.module.ts: import all the needed indiviudal modules from 'ngx-bootstrap'
											All individual files: import individual parts from 'ngx-bootstrap'
											Exception: xxx.spec.ts: has to import modules as well just like: app.module.ts
											==>Mostly: you can see: JS part is also in use beyond bootstrap CSS part: ngx-bootstrap is mainly JS code and functions
											==>Bootstrap css is still coming from: "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"
											==>Also some packages are installed due to dependencies scenarios: used by some other packages inside node_modules
												==>TBD: is ng-bootstrap a dependency for ngx-bootstrap? - like javax depends upon java
							==>Procedures:
								==>Get to documentation:
									https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/modals ==>Real documentation
									https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/documentation
									https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/
								==>
								
								
								
								==>ng build:	normally: dist folder
												RMT-UI: where to build to: maybe go to target folder: due to maven plugin's enablement... ==>Actually: in war file...
												
								==>RMT-UI: Stylishing:
									==>
									==>style.css: where included
									==>bootstrap css: where included

Topic:	Google Map:

==>This is a native impl of Google Map: like AGM UI Component

==>Google Map: display:
	==>Just one single statement: it will display a google map
		==>The google map: from @types/googlemaps
	
	==>Manipulation of Google Map:
		==>Delegate to the global App Level Service APIs, instead of the component code
		==>But the App Level API calls, still call map component functions
		
	==>Showing Results:
	
		==>Delegate to the global App Level Service APIs:
			==>The App Level API calls, call results component functions to display the results
