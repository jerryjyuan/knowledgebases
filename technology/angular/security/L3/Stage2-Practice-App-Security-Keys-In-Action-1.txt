		==>SSL/TLS Ecosystems:		
			==>SSL/TLS:	Not only just Java associated + it is web associated + some non-web associated + also probably linked to some app types like SOA/WebServices calls (client -> MF/CICS web services)
					==>Secure Socket Layer / Transport Layer Security:
						==>...
						1) Java Web Apps: using HTTPS
							==>Java Web Apps: deployed on internet + mainly accept HTTP/HTTPS requests
							==>HTTP/HTTPS requests: from client browsers (browsers: mostly send HTTP/HTTPS)
							==>HTTP/HTTPS requests: from client Java/Other Apps: use: Apache HttpClient, etc. ==>These requests do similar as browsers sending...
						2) Java Web Apps: using WS
							==>Java Web Apps: deployed on internet + could accept both HTTP/HTTPS and/or WS requests
							==>HTTP/HTTPS requests: see above
							==>WS requests: from client browsers (browsers: can send WS as well: ws://...)
							==>WS requests: from client Java/Other Apps: ==>These requests do similar as browsers sending WS...
							======>Are the server apps are similar to Spring Boot WebSocket server applications?
							======>WS Requests: can enable longer time and endurable connections from client -> server
							======>Such as: chatting, trading, ... apps
						3) Web Apps: using HTTPS: similar but non-Java apps
						4) Web Apps: using WS:	  similar but non-Java apps
						5) Java Non-Web Apps: using Socket:
							======>Because socket is not sending over HTTP (which is called WS)
							======>Example 1:	Teradata JDBC driver - connects to Teradata DB: using normal socket connection
										==>Because Teradata DB is not deployed on web/HTTP portfolios
										==>Did Tom add SSL to Teradata JDBC driver, or did we need?
							======>Example 2:	IADT Desk Client -> MF/CICS Web Services Apps:
										==>It is not using web/http because CICS apps - should be in non-web scenarios
										==>So IADT client sends socket connection to CICS apps
										==>But socket communications can be secured, which is like SSL
											==>But this enabling might be different or varied from common browser->Tomcat...
											==>IADT client might add it to the Socket Factory connection calls (or 2 trips as well?)
											==>Anyways, it also just tried to establish a secure or SSL connection
											==>These communication ways could vary due to vendors/impl/design/APIs etc.
											Example 1: Gmail: requires both sender and recipient to establish TLS
											...
						6) Non-Java Non-Web Apps: using Socket: similar but non-Java apps
					==>Common Web SSL Certificates: common for all web applications and websites
						==>EV: Extended Validation SSL Certificate: domain+organization+countryId+ ...: more trustful (maybe JDK jks's trusted key store is similar to this)
							- So clients might be more trustful when conducting credit card or security information transactions with this website/server
						==>OV: Show organizational info as well
						==>DV: Domain Validated SSL Certificate: so clients could be doubtful: ... (locked padlock)
					==>Java-Scenarios Web SSL certificates: Examples:
						==>Java related JKS is part of the common web SSL certificates (EV/OV/DV)
						==>Tomcat: server.xml: linked to JRE jks: this jks contains
							1) Trusted Key Stores: common JDK/JRE installations should have these common ones
								==>So Tomcat server.xml utilizes some of the trusted key stores in JRE to do SSL
								==>Because it is some common trusted one, so most clients will trust it
							2) Company-Enabled Key Stores:
								==>Tomcat: They need to add them to JRE JKS
							3) Website-Enabled Key Stores
								==>Tomcat: They need to add them to JRE JKS
								(but the client browser etc might be doubtful about non-trusted SSL certificate...)
							==>Tomcat can use customized name/location/etc JKS by creating a new one and link to server.xml (by the JKS file location)
							==>Why Tomcat uses that JRE .jks file? because it is some trusted SSL certificates installed in that jks, so server.xml links it to enable SSL
								(internally Tomcat source code picks up this jks via server.xml, and send one certificate to the client browser like the SSL Trip 1)
								==>This meets the above common HTTPS/SSL processing mechanism
						==>Other non-Tomcat scenarios might use different / their own ways to store/link and serve the SSL certificate to the client
						==>The entire key is: 
							How does the SSL enabled server (not necessarily Java or Tomcat) return a SSL certificate to the client request during "Trip 1"
							and let client agree with it (send back an encrypted key to server) and start Trip 2...
						==>Also it is the SSL enabled server side to send this certificate to establish an SSL session
							Would client side ever send the SSL copy to the server during trip 1 to establish it?
			==>Point 1:	Client(mostly browsers - due to http/https / it can be a server too or tool: like IADT Desktop)-on-internet sends request/access to this server
			==>Point 2:	HTTP: generally speaking naturally enabled - no special configurations on the server
			==>Point 3:	But server wants to enable HTTPS access to the server: adding SSL certificates to server sides
					1) Step 1:	Server enables its HTTPS settings: so clients can send HTTPS url requests
							==>Tomcat: has a port: 9443 
							   (web server 443 https: like Apache - AJP13 via 8009 to Tomcat at 9443)
							==>server.xml: enable this port to take HTTPS request
					2) 
					2) NW:		IADT Desktop: ...key stores...:
							==>Client: not a browser / it is AWT/Swing desktop client application
							==>Server: MF/CICS Web Services Applications
							==>Need:   Enable an SSL call: Java HTTPS calls
							==>HOW?	   1) client: send a call using Java code: via Socket with SSL/TLS connection
								   2) Server: Web Service end points: expect an SSL socket request

							==>So how to enable an SS(ocket)L(ayer)/TLS(Transport Layer) connection: scenarios could VARY:
								1) Scenario 1:	WebBrowser -> Typical-Web-Server-Like-Tomcat: mechanims are listed above - 2 trips
										==>SSL: client-server domain: but server: online web server
										==>Belongs to HTTPS
								2) Scenario 2:	S(ecure)SH(shell): SSL connection on shell / linux connection: or similar
										==>Use the common protocol: public/private keys:
										==>SSH: client-server domain: but server: Linux/Unix shell
										==>Belongs to SSH - maybe different HTTPS
										More: sftp/scp/...
								3) Scenario 3:	Socket communications and WS communcations
								4) ...
							
			==>Point 4:	Why is SSL Certificate needed?
					1) Function 1:	Enable the core nature of SSL: establish an SSL "session" between client and server
					2) Processing:	Enable Rubi to be the processor of this processing under the master-slave methodology
							==>Step 1: Trip 1: client sends a request to the SSL enabled server
							==>Step 2: server returns the response page with a copy of SSL certificate
									(which is why the client browser can right click somewhere close
										to the address bar and download this copy)
									==>Tomcat: the JKS SSL certificates are common ones: so most of the browsers trust it
							==>Step 3: Trip 2: client checks it and see if it trusts this SSL certificate (sometimes browser pops up a warning): if so, respond back
							==>Step 4: SSL enabled server sends back (2nd trip) to client with a signed ack to start the SSL session: also the encrypted contents
