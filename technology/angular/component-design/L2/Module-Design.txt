============================================================
Some Modules:
	https://angular.io/guide/router-tutorial-toh#clear-secondary-routes

==>Take an example module:

	A crisis center with child routes
	
	This section shows you how to organize the crisis center to conform to the following recommended pattern for Angular applications:
	
		Each feature area resides in its own folder.
		Each feature has its own Angular feature module.
		Each area has its own area root component.
		Each area root component has its own router outlet and child routes.
		Feature area routes rarely (if ever) cross with routes of other features.

	==>Not every module is enabled as this design
