#Goals:

#Procedure:

##Angular UI - Page Navigation:

1. Browsers:
	==>HTML5 Browsers: History.pushState:
		1) HTML5 support this JavaScript feature: Web App JavaScript code can code this feature to build up URL
			==>Angular app: can do this feature as well: without "#" sign
				==>The Angular router can compose a "natural" URL that is indistinguishable from one that would otherwise require a page load
				==>localhost:3002/crisis-center/
				==>When the router navigates to a new component view, it updates the browser's location and history with a URL for that view.
				==>As this is a strictly local URL the browser won't send this URL to the server and will not reload the page.
	==>Older Browsers:
		==> < HTML5: Older browsers send page requests to the server when the location URL changes unless the change occurs after a "#" (called the "hash")
			(Aka: Not sending a server request: https://server:port/app/#/<page>: this will navigate to <page> without sending a server request)
			==>Angular app: need to support older browsers that may not support HTML5 above
				==>So Angular enables one more strategy: HashLocationStrategy
				==>Angular app enables this strategy so any older browsers from users can use Angular app normally
	==>
	
2. Angular:
	==>Feature: in-app navigation: navigate to some page (component) without sending a request to the server
	==>Utilize: the above HTML5's History.pushState (PathLocationStrategy) and also # feature (HashLocationStrategy)
		==>localhost:3002/crisis-center/
		==>localhost:3002/src/#/crisis-center/
	
	The router supports both styles with two LocationStrategy providers:	
		PathLocationStrategy—the default "HTML5 pushState" style.
		HashLocationStrategy—the "hash URL" style.
	The RouterModule.forRoot() function sets the LocationStrategy to the PathLocationStrategy, which makes it the default strategy. 
	You also have the option of switching to the HashLocationStrategy with an override during the bootstrapping process.
