==>Rename:
	==>Method 1: Manual changes:
		==>For all names except the project/application names:
			==>1) Create a new component and remove old component, and conduct a migration
			==>2) Manual change the older names into new names: unless too many:
					==>Search and Replace (excluding node_modules): work to some degree - because the names in apps don't go to node_modules except the project/application names
		==>For project/application (and workspace name) names:
			==>Unsure how to alter the names in node_modules for these names
	==>Method 2: Use npm package: angular-rename:
		==>Not approved to be working yet
	==>Method 3: IDE: "Rename (Reference)" menu or commands
		==>This is safer than using global search and replace?
	==>Method 4: Using global search and replace
	
==>Rename Components:

	$ npm install angular-rename --save-dev
	$ angular-rename OldNameComponent NewNameComponent
