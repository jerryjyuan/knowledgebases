App Components:

- HTML template files:

	===>Add normal HTML elements
		===>Many core HTML tags could have material counterpart components
	===>Add Material Design Components:
		- 1) Simplify the HTML
		- 2) Take Material components like what your OWN components you want to create to enable HTML display
			 ===>But not for functions: function components become your app real components
			 ===>These material components:
			 	 1) simply the HTML
			 	 2) also enable many UI displays
	===>Add your application functional components

- CSS style URLs:
	===>Similar to Spring Boot, if you don't add anything, it uses the defaults or globals
	===>Also there are 4 default themes, those defaults can enable default css for this component
	===>You can add this component's specific styles into this file
