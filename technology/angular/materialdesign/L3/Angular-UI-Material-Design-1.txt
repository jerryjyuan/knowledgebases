Angular UI: Enable Material Design

npm install @angular/cli
ng add @angular/material:
	- add angular material, CDK, animations

import { MatDialog } from '@angular/material';

Good Examples:

=========================================================== 
Angular UI:
	>=50% Angular UI Applications: Use Material Design

===>Enable Angular UI app as a material design:
	ng add...
	Or: manually them into package.json
	===>This is the way how Angular Material, Animations, and CDK get into the app
	===>This is the way how Angular UI has its Animation APIs and features integrated with Material Design
		===>Similar to @SpringBootApplication: 3 annotations together
	
===>Some of advanced Material Design: require dependencies:
	hammerjs: gesture recognition

===>Treat Material Design Modules: like another sub-module undernearth app-root component

	app-root
		xxx-maintenance-tool
			create-edit
			xxxConfiguration
			xxxstein
		dock
		login
		material-design:
			MD Module
			MD Components
			MD Schematics...
			
			===>In this way, we can easily know how to use MD modules/components/...
			===>How to use Material Design components - similar to how to use: xxx-yyy-configuration-table component
			
===>Differences between MD and CDK:
	- MD: existing components - UI parts
	- CDK: Dev Kit...
		   - More like some additional or advanced components and developing components
	-
