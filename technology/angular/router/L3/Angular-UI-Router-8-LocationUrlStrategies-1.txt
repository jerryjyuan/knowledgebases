Angular UI - Router: Location Strategies

- Defaults:	all about HTML5 browsers
			===>Support html5 styles + avoid sending to server - when enable local history urls, etc.
	PathLocationStrategy and HTML5 browser URL styles 
	- but:
	  need:
		1) Method 1: Optimal:	<base href="/">
								- The browser uses the <base href> value to prefix relative URLs when referencing CSS files, scripts, and images.
								- If not:  the browser may not be able to load resources (images, CSS, scripts) when "deep linking" into the app
		2) Method 2: Use: [APP_BASE_HREF][] value
		3) Method 3: Add rootUrls
	- Reason 1: Use "the above html5 style":to enable HTML5 history.pushState: so the in-app url is pretty
	- Reason 2: Performance: It is also a requirement later during the app impl: "Rendering critical pages on the server"
				This option is only available if application URLs look like normal web URLs without hashes (#) in the middle.
	- 

	Old Ways:
		- Also want to avoid sending to server - but need to use older way: #
		- So need:
			HashLocationStrategy
			Cons:
				- The in-app url is not pretty: due to "#"
				  ===>So current Angular doesn't like it - but able to support it
