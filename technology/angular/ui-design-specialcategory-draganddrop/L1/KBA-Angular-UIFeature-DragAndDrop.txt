##Angular UI - Drag and Drop + File Upload:

1. HTML:
	Concepts:
		Drag an item/data: get an HTML element
		Drop: append the item/data with the destination element


	Design:
		==>1) Events:
				==>1) Identify HTML events involved
				==>2) Associate each of the events with the user mouse/keyboard processes
		==>2) HTML Elements:
				==>1) Define/Add HTML elements
				==>2) Add each of the HTML events into each of the HTML elements:
					  HTML's attributes on<event>="js-function(event)" <-> map each <event>
					  (on<event> is the representation of the events, and argument uses: "event" as the name
					  target is the associated HTML element with specific event
				==>3) Extract the event handling code into JS file

		Events have some associated APIs:
			preventDefault(): some events have default behaviors
			dataTransfer...

		Drag-And-Drop Events
			https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API#Drag_Events
			eight events the browser fires related to drag and drop: drag, dragend, dragenter, dragexit, dragleave, dragover, dragstart, and drop. We won’t be going over all of them because drag, dragend, dragexit, and dragstart are all fired on the element that is being dragged

	Mechanism/DesignLogic:
		1) Drag-and-Drop: Utilize events: ondrop... =>handleDrop =>handleFiles =>Utilize XHR calls to submit form data
		2) Select Files to Upload: =>input =>onchange=>handleFiles =>Utilize XHR calls to submit form data

	Procedure for Drag and Drop:
		Step 1: Make an object draggable. First set the draggable attribute to true for that element to be draggable <img draggable = “true”> Then, specify what should happen when the element is dragged. ...
		Step 2: Dropping the Object. The ondragover event specifies where the dragged data can be dropped.

	How to Use HTML5 File Drag and Drop
		enable file dragging and dropping onto a web page element.
		analyze dropped files in JavaScript.
		load and parse files on the client.
		asynchronously upload files to the server using XMLHttpRequest2.
		show a graphical progress bar while the upload occurs.
