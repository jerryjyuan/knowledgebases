Google Map Integration: Application Implementation Procedures

(1) All Parts (Components): total 12:
	1) APIs:
		==>Native Google Map JavaScript APIs:
			https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/xxx
			https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/xxx#yyy
			https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
		==>Google Map API UI Component:
			==>1) No Angular official API documents found yet: because it is new to Angular 9.x
			==>2) Go to: 
					components\src\google-maps\<part>\<part>.ts
					Or: https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/google-maps/README.md
	1) @Input properties:
		==>Look for @Input properties:
		==>1-1) Properties: primitive types: can be directly used
		==>1-2) Properties: API object types: need to look up Google JavaScript APIs:
							Example: google.maps.MapOptions
							  	https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/map#MapOptions
							==>Configurations: very complicated: To Explore
	2) @Output() properties:
		==>Very complicated: need to explore one by one
		==>Aka: events: inside Angular code: it is an EventEmitter

	3) GoogleMap HTML template reference:
		==>GoogleMap Component/Part:
		   ==>Class-level: Methods and getters
		   ==>These class members can be found inside these component classes
		   ==>These class members provide manipulations and accesses to the component instance: just like any app-component's methods and public variables
		   ==>These class members are accessed via the part's HTML references inside HTML file selector, and @ViewChild('xxx')
		   ==>These class members are the same as API document's API contents (such as: Angular MD and CDK APIs contents)
		   Functions:
		   		Provide internal functionalities to interact with all variables and other functions
		   		Provide inter-component methods via constructor and method calls
