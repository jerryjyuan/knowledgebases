Integration Guide:

==>Procedures:

	(1) Installations
		https://www.ag-grid.com/documentation/angular/getting-started/
		npm install --save ag-grid-community
		npm install --save ag-grid-angular
	(2) Configurations:
		==>import { AgGridModule } from 'ag-grid-angular';
		==>Add Ag-Grid's CSS/theme files:
			@import "../node_modules/ag-grid-community/dist/styles/ag-grid.css";
			@import "../node_modules/ag-grid-community/dist/styles/ag-theme-alpine.css";
			==>This is important because it contains: CSS for the structures and styling
			
			The code above imports the grid "structure" stylesheet (ag-grid.css), 
			and one of the available grid themes: (ag-theme-alpine.css). 
			The grid ships several different themes; pick one that matches your project design. 
			You can customise it further with Sass variables, a technique which we will cover further down the road.
