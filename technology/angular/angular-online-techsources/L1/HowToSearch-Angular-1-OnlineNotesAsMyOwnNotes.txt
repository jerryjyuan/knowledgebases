Why keeping brushing up Angular:

	==>IT/Tech: I have been a tech guy, so tech is one main part of my life parts
	==>Java:    I don't need to become super hands-on in everything except Java-Domains (including web/JS parts)
				==>Because you cannot know every domain as super-hands-on except 1-2 main domains
				==>And Java-domain(s) is my default and enabled choice(s) of these super-hands-on domain(s)
				==>And Java-domain(s) is actually No.1 tech-domains in IT/tech world
				==>And Java-domain(s) can do the same solutions as any other 6 IT domains
				==>And Angular is part of Java-domains' brothers or parts, so Jerry includes Angular as part of Java-Domains
	==>Other Domains: can do everything except the higher-standards of "super-hans-on"
	==>But Jerry can still develop insights and products scenarios in all tech sectors and all IT domains
