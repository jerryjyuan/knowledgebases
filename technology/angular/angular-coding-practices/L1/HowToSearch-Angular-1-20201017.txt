	==>Every 6-month a new release: just like TomNolan/BobbAlex: they will collect all new APIs changes into next release, not with minor/bug-fix releases, ...

		==>How to match documents and source code?
			==>The list on documents: match the source code's main container:
				==>Summaries:
					==>Each of them is: a "large" component:
										==>with its own module: in this regard, larger than normal Angular component
										==>with public-api.ts: similar to node_modules/* dependencies
										==>with index.ts: ...
										Why having both public-api.ts and index.ts?
											==>Maybe suitable to be used for multiple integration/usage/client/app scenarios ==>Because this is MD API integration product
										==>Its Module:
											Similar to any other modules and also root module - but doesn't do root module's duties: bootstrapping
										==>Its HTML:
											<ng-content></ng-content>
											<ng-content select="mat-toolbar-row"></ng-content>
											==>What is ng-content? ==>TBD
											==>As a container MD component, its HTML is limited, not a lot code
					==>Each one: follow the same Angular component concept/structure 
									+ same scenarios as node_module/* dependencyPackage 
									+ additional-advanced-features-more-than-normal-component: such as: SCSS, 
				==>Example 1: Toolbar: as a component:
						   ==>https://github.com/angular/components/tree/8.2.x/src/material/toolbar
						   ==>All the sub-parts under "Toolbar": are inside the above source code container:
						   ==>The API document contents can be resembled inside source code
						   ==>The same file: contains both @Component: MatToolbar, and @Directive: MatToolbarRow
						   ==>Inter-component communication/data-flows: can be applied to @Directive as well:
								==>Component: As a special Directive (sub-class of Directive) with a selector and a view: component.html
								==>Directive: Directive doesn't have a view: no: xxx.html
								==>But Directive can have a Selector:
									==>This is normal: this selector for this kind of Directive in HTML pages is: just a tag shown: no underneath html code rendered (by xxx.html)
						   ==>
						   ==>Examples:
								https://stackblitz.com/angular/xkxkvpjlyqk?file=src%2Fapp%2Ftoolbar-multirow-example.ts
								==>Build: as AngularCLI
								==>Angular files: very flexible...: can contain many TS code, ...
									==>Why?
										==>Reason 1: TS code are flexible, ...
										==>Reason 2: All TS code are compiled (packaged) into several main JS files, ..., big files, ..., not like Java's individual class files, ...
													 ==>So TS files are very flexible to contain many class/parts contents, ...
								==>Use: SCSS: style.scss
								==>The MD UI HTML source code: very good examples to know how to use them in app
