=========>How to Deliver Special Scenarios Ways:

(1) Examples:
	==>POCs
	==>Mr Han's project
	==>
	
	==>Freelancer.com
	==>Bidding
	==>Auctioning


(2) Methods:
	==>Method 1:	Enable "In-Action: POCs" in your github repos and CL (Continuous Learning): this is the best keys
						(That is why many good developers all have some githubs' repos and example apps...)
						(You think: Mkyong.com only for showing us as tutorials? - he also uses them for his own projects...)
						(I think many magic developers use this way a lot (they have had various in-action-POCs in place ...) and very well besides you think:
							==>They do that overnight
							==>They hide inside some caves...
							==>They are super smart...
							Even Peter Yellow relied heavily upon "early education" and "special training" and "early/intensive preparations"
						)
						==>These in-action-POCs (apps - not just summaries: avoid any ongoing research) have huge values in reality for all kinds of developers
						==>It is also a way of tracing and keeping updated with all new tech and best tech and most popular tech
					==>Not just summaries or templates ==>Make it a real "In-Action-POC" app
					==>This is the best ways to handle "Mr Han's projects":
						==>If you have these in-action-POC in place, then delivering MrHan's projects only takes: 2-4 hours
					==>This is also the best ways to handle many projects - that require immediate delivery or overnight delivery
	==>Method 2:	Staged - POCs: POCs also can be enabled as "staged"
	
	==>Method 3:	Overinight...
	
	==>Method 7:	Special and Basic-Tolerance Simulating:
					==>Without violating copyrights
					==>Only concerns are:
						==>Show stupidity - due to not thinking on your own
						==>Show some possible issues
					==>But: the good parts are: 
						==>now: more open-sources
						==>Spring-Boot
						==>Templates
	==>Method 8:	Kesava's ways: ask for 2-week close-door Quartz Scheduler ramp-up
	

============================================================
=========>Tech and Working Ways:

==>Puppet: someone told you to run this, then run it, no other things...
==>...
==>Immediate Use: pick it up...
==>
==>Core Flows: very core parts...
==>
==>Complete scenarios - summaries
==>...Expert

==>Know Whys - complete
==>Think and insights
==>Put into doc and share with the team
==>Build up your portfolios
==>...
==>Build up your Kingdom: call Mark Zuckberg
==>Build up your Empire: call Larry Page ...
(dynasty...)
==>Build up your Union: call Larry Ellison or Bill Gates...
==>...




============================================================
=========>Coding Ways:

==>Scaffolding => POC => Add features one by one => Productionize =>

==>CenterRipplizing:
	==>Start from the most center methods/APIs and ripplizing into other parts
	==>Example 1: start from: restTemplate.exchange() call
	==>Example 2: start from: webserviceTemplate.marshalSendAndReceive() call
	
	PROS:
		==>More accurate
		==>Easier
		==>Faster
	
	Comparative Methods:
		==>Sequencing
		==>Backwarding
		==>Read API doc and impl...
		==>Big methods first and divide into smaller methods
		==>

============================================================
=========>Angular UI - Coding Ways:

==>Use Wireframe/Mockup/Prototype: enable look and feel:
	Justifications:
	1) Mostly: these look and feel and UI designs are: the work for Production Manager / Business Analysts / UI Designers
	2) Even from them: they generally create these mockups and wireframes by using tools - very little chances they create by HTML handwriting
		==>If they or most of the ones in the UI world create UI design like these using tools, why do we as developers need to create UI by hand-writing html code?
	3) Also: creation by tools are more accurate to suit look and feel, and also super faster
	
==>

==>Blind typing coding is not so easy:
	==>Method 1: POC helps enormously + AOP-Summaries help a lot
	==>Method 2: Faster
	==>Method 3: Save time to do research and do repeated research
	==>...
	
	
	TS2341: Property 'numberField2' is private and only accessible within class 'LookupComponent'
	
	
============================================================
Misc:

==>Windows Systems:
	==>
	==>PATH:
		==>Method 1:	Admin Users - HelpDesk/ServiceDesk/...
						==>Need to add: System-Panel variables - not user-panel variables: otherwise==>Add to that admin-user's private variables
		==>


==>Linux Systems


==>Unix Systems


==>...

============================================================
Some Strategies:

==>Example 1: if someone is suspicious about your using other one to do coding for you - like work from home, or...
	==>Demo yourself
	==>Show screen-sharing to show you know the code...
	==>Humiliate him... - we do need to do so sometimes...
	==>
	
==>Example 2: if someone is using this as a strategy: be suspicious about (or explicitly... - see example below) your using other one to do coding for you - like work from home, or...
				==>But he/she actually knows you are doing your own coding, not using others, but use it as a strategy, ..., like some Chinamen, or ...
	==>Humiliate him... - we do need to do so sometimes... ==>Only use this way
	==>Take some or all his/her drawbacks and start targeting them using 4P scenarios: precaution, prevention, preemptive, preoccuption, ...
	==>
	
	Why do they do this, then?
		- make you nervous
		- psychologically control you
		- psychologically make you submissive
		- abuse you
		- make you difficult
		- make you being tested or in test mode
		- test you
		
		- harass you
		- make you do more ...
		
	Some Examples:
		- Explicit:
			==>2000 years ago: Premier Zhao pointed to a deer and told everyone in the cabinet and said: this is a horse, ...
			==>In 2026, China CCP President Xi told everyone in China: China has been having the best democracy and no one died in 1989 students demonstrations
		- Suspicious
		- Pretend to be suspicious
		- 
	
	
Arguments?
	==>FBI and CCP and some networks and abusers' definitions are WRONG! - no need to argue with wrong definitions!
	==>
	
	
	...Cascaded / Cascading allegation methodologies and ways: from abusers and FBI/CCP...:
		==>When some of their big / bigger definitions or allegations cannot be validated or sold to others or Jerry, then:
			==>They switched to medium or very small ones and try to do the same, and most of them are also invalidated and wrong, then, they also try to
				pinpoint very tiny ones and make them bigger...
				......
				......
		==>
	
Concept: Also innocent
