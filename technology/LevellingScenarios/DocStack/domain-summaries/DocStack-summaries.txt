					==>Primarily: should not use: Nannyman-teaching ways or documentation ways
					==>But: for useful teaching to someones like Rubi: Jerry tends to use Nanyman-ways... (because of easy/fast or even immediate understanding...)
						(But based on human natures and common world: many or most of so-called teachers/tutors don't want to or don't know about Nannyman-teaching ways) 
						(due to LOE and efforts, ...)
						(due to the fact that many or most of so-called teachers/tutors deal with or handle "average/general-people" scenarios...)
						(and intelligent ones or pre-study ones can understand better...)
						
					Also most of people: not put thinking/analytical/... - processing into notes...
