KT:

	==>Depends upon many factors
	
		==>"TIME": Time is No.1:
			==>Any KT/Communications/...: take time and hours
			
			Under many scenarios of human life/living/work/etc: "TIME" can be explaining many things...
		
		==>Scopes/Domains
		
		==>Needs:
			Extra
			In need / needed
			Security data
			...
			Principles:
				Only needed and/or approved...: minimal info-levels to do the work...
				...
			
		==>Availability

		==>Anyone's their own homework: 
			Nanny? 
			Their-qualifications? 
			Can they google? 
			Can they create/collect/enable their own OneNote?
				==>Currently: Jerry doesn't feel: OneNote is a sharable document type or team-document type...
			Use-Others? 
			Delegating-Too-Much?
			Is this becoming teaching (or even tutoring, ...) instead of: normal teamwork, normal team doc or KT, or normal syncup?
			You want someones or your team to be up to speed, can you find some other ways (many good ways)...

				==>...
			Some Principles:
				You want yourself to be treated in some ways, then you need to treat others in the same/similar ways, ...

			==>How do others get treated while you are treated? the same/similar ways?
			==>Company Hires: mostly not for teaching/tutoring...
				==>Tutoring: mostly for supervising or guidances to ensure better productivity...
			==>...
	
		==>Any abuses?
	
	
	==>Scenarios:
	
	
		==>
		
		==>
		
		==>Summarize all tickets or problem definitions:
			==>Overall: overdo
			==>All tickets: in SN
			==>All problem definitions: in SN and also ...		
			
		==>Tricks:
			==>Most of the tricks:
				1) Not tricks or even tips
				2) Most of them: in official documentation, user guides, and manuals, or just its features...
