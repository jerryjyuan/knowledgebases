Tech Fairness:

==>[Jerry]: Domain-Age/Experiences-Fairness: ==>Self-Summaries:
	==>Related Factors:
		Age
		Experiences count
		Fairness: team members + team duties + common-scenarios (HumanWorld-jobs/USA-jobs/IT-industry/TCS/TCS-FM/TCS-FM-L3)
	==>Summary:
		1) Scenario: Job Duties: Duties Fulfillment:
					   ==>I can do the SAME
		2) Scenario: Job Duties: Duties: Do-Better:
					   ==>I can do better when applicable
					   ==>Actually: I have done better when applicable
					   	  1) Example 1: Full-stack / 33%-dev / ...
					   	  2) Example 2: 
		3) Scenario: When switching to a new job/client: duties/work-type/tech/...
					 Example 1: Can Mahesh compare with Jerry?
		4) Scenario: Considering "Full-stack engineer":
					 Example 1: Can most of L3 compare with Jerry?
		5) Scenario: In both short-term and long-run scenarios and "complicated-problems" scenarios:
					 Example 1: Can "Dhivya" and "Qian, Min" compare with Jerry?
		6) Scenario: Real performance and results:
					 1) Compare with junior/young engineers:
						 ==>Factor/Example 1: time:
						 					  ==>how about Jerry's spending more time? (if only one-job duties)
						 ==>Factor/Example 2: how about Dhivya doing the same MF Bonds incident "Duplicate Wires" RCA?
						 ==>
					 2) Compare with experienced engineers:
					 	 ==>Example: Compare with non-full-stack:
					 	 		==>Full-stack:
					 	 			==>Is most of L3 able to do full-stack like Jerry?
					 	 		==>
					 	 ==>Example: Compare with full-stack:
					 	 		==>Example 1: Narender
					 	 			==>[Jerry]:
					 	 				Is Narender doing other apps' support or more duties than 1-month break-fix PROD-Deployment for back button?
					 	 			==>[Jerry]:
					 	 				If anyone does the same company-procedures like Narender's 1-month break-fix PROD-Deployment for back button
					 	 				Why cannot Jerry do the same due to fairness and procedures? and Jerry has to do 2-week release?
					 	 				[Someones]: just demonstrate how well you are
					 	 				[Jerry]:    wrong. it will lead to some PROD defects due to lack of procedures
					 	 				[Someones]: because you got higher pays
					 	 				[Jerry]:    wrong: 1) I am not getting higher pays 2) also even someones with higher pays can do the same tasks at one time based on overall career scenarios
					 	 				[Someones]: due to job security
					 	 				[Jerry]:    wrong. because the company-procedures are the standards
					 	 				[Someones]: due to your being experienced engineer
					 	 				[Jerry]:    wrong. Each task has its own natures plus company-procedures. This is not related to someone being experienced
					 	 							Aka: experiences-count should not be a factor of this kind of task's completion based on company-procedures and fairness and normal standards
					 	 				[Someones]: En, then someones asked: why did it take you actually 1 more week than Narender?
					 	 				[Jerry]:	Because I have had 2-3 other tasks ongoing at that time while Narender only focused on this task during that month

					 	 ==>[Jerry]:
					 	 		==>Measure 1: normalized his L3 role:
					 	 			==>Age: Jerry didn't tell anyone about his age in L3/FM: trying to normalize his L3 member status
					 	 				==>Exception 1: 04/2021: looked for a new role/client: so sent out resume
					 	 				(Resume: removed BS degree in resume so no one could guess Jerry's age due to age-fairness needs)
					 	 				(Resume: showed MS in 2000: someones can still guess Jerry's age:
					 	 						==>It could be close to age of 40s if someones think: Jerry graduated in year 2000 as MS at age of 25: 25+20=>45)
					 	 					1) So Jerry: functions like age of 40s: ok: because of his exercices and healthy living styles
					 	 					2) So Jerry: Jerry shows his young profile image
					 	 					3) So Jerry: works like age of 40s for both L3 on-call/shifts/work + any other client work as developers
					 	 				)
=					 	 			==>Tech/Experiences: Jerry didn't tell anyone about his 18-year experiences in L3/FM: trying to normalize his L3 member status
					 	 				==>Exception 1: 04/2021: looked for a new role/client
					 	 				==>Exception 2: showcased his tech background when someones pinpointed some of his errors
					 	 		==>Measure 2: showcase: L3 can have experienced engineers plus L3 can have L3-specialists like RCA/Code-Developer, etc.
		7) Scenario: All related aspects:
					 ==>Insights

		10) Scenario: Pays and Duties: See below analysis
	
	
	==>Pays and Duties:
		==>Jerry's Scenarios
		==>TCS-Scenarios:
			==>TCS
			==>TCS-FM
			==>TCS-FM-L3:
				[Someones or L3]: I have heard that Jerry has had 18-year IT experiences, ...so and why ...
				[Jerry]:		  I like IT and I promote: age-neutrality and fairness, so everyone can work on IT regardless of age
				[Someones or L3]: We think age is indeed a factor even considering age-fairness, ...
				[Jerry]: 		  But someones could be special (if age-fairness is ok overall), isn't it?
				[Someones or L3]: So we think your pay may be much higher than us, so we should let you do more work, ...
				[Jerry]:		  Due to special scenarios, my pay is just slightly or moderately higher than some of you, but Manish's pay is higher than me, ...
								  So this is another special scenario about me
				[Someones or L3]: So we have had you do more in morning health check even when you were the secondary, this was wrong?
				[Jerry]:          It was wrong
				[Someones or L3]: But someones said that because you didn't more when you were initially joining L3, so it was a makeup "more"
				[Jerry]:		  This is also wrong because as a new team member of some teams like L3, accommodating new members' slowness or unfamiliarity is normal
								  and should not be treated as "later-on-makeup", and it should be normal scenario after being not new any more
				[Someones or L3]: Someones said that you were willing to do more and it was based on your initiatives
				[Jerry]:		  Might be, but mostly we should do normal ways and fairness ways...
				[Someones or L3]: Then one more question is: why did you do L3 or production support work?
				[Jerry]:		  As a TCS employee, we could move from client to client, so working on various work types for some clients is still normal,
								  and we can do various duties when moving to another client
				[Someones or L3]: We thought that you got much higher pays than us, so ...
				[Jerry]:		  This is not so true, like I said, as an example, Manish has higher pay than me to my knowledge, ...
								  Also L3 team can still have various experienced engineers, and their pays could be higher, which is normal
				[Someones or L3]: Are you sure that you have shown much better scenarios or good scenarios when you compare with other L3 in terms of experiences?
				[Jerry]:		  It really depends:
								  1) As a TCS employee, we move to different clients, which could be short-term like less than 1-2 years, this doesn't have sufficient
								  	 bandwidths to showcase so-called leadership or SME, or tech lead, or much better performance
								  	 Mostly it is just a fulfillment of client job duties
								  	 Overall better scenarios are reflected in TCS ranks and overall job scenarios
								  2) I have had some personal specials as well
								  	 1) I have other life/work balance factors including time contributions
								  	 2) I am not actually being treated or expected to do "tech lead" roles so far with TCS clients
								  	 3) Regarding my L3 app support: I have done full-stack roles: 33% dev tasks, etc. so indeed I have done quite better than some of L3
		==>USA-IT-Industry Scenarios:
			Notes:
				Annual increase of pays (if any): generally speaking, include the inflation factors in USA as a nation level
			==>Teradata:
				Jerry:
					2004: $80K
					2005: $83K
					2006: $85K
					...If still in Qualcomm in 2020: ==>$2000(or: 2000-2500)/year x 14: ==>$113K
			==>Qualcomm:
				Jerry:
					2007: $90K
					2008: $92K
					2009: $94K
					2010: $96K
					...If still in Qualcomm in 2020: ==>$2000(or: 2000-2500)/year x 10: ==>$116K (Qualcomm has one of the IT-company's benefits program)
				One girl in one other team:
					(In year 2009 or 2010, there was one time when I walked to a printer, I saw one printed out page: it was some other girl's print-out with her salary...)
					Her Salary: $$95K or $97K, ..., and I knew her name, and she was similar to Raghuram or Grace scenario (for sure below a manager like Henry Chin), ...)
			==>
		==>IT-Industry Scenarios:
			==>India-IT-Services-Companies: have been caught up with world-standards and IT-standards after 2/3-decades streamlinizations
			==>TCS: TCS' USA employees: overall matching up with USA-IT-Jobs:
				==>Additional factors:
				1) TCS: H1-B employees: processing fees for green cards and H1-B plus related benefits
				2) TCS: bench-time pay indeed being as a factor
				3) TCS: some employees are not 100% USA based employees (have India bases): for those, the pays are lower to some degree
				4) TCS: some employees fit into TCS's No.1 Indian IT company portfolios: resources pooling/pools are one of its global strategies as IT services company
						==>Due to resources pooling/pools scenarios: various less-experienced engineers are hired:
						   Examples:
						   		Steven, ..., ...
						   		Onsite-teams: assimilations (in-team-training) and internal-structuring scenarios
						   		(some on-site teams: do not require "client-interviews")
				So how much lower pays should a normal TCS USA employee be compared with normal USA-IT-engineer?
				   $15K differences on average: such as: $110K vs $125K
				==>Questions:
				   [Someone]: What about Jerry's TCS salary?
				   [Jerry]:   Due to some reasons (see below): TCS treated Jerry as lower-pay in 2018/10
				   [Someone]: So what salary do you think you should have TCS pay considering overall scenarios?
				   [Jerry]:   If just considering common-scenarios: I think my 10/2018 hire-salary should be: $115K-$120K (compared with $100K)
				   [Someone]: Why is it?
				   [Jerry]:   Here is my listing:
				   			  1) I didn't need "H1-B employees: processing fees"
				   			  2) I was 100% USA-based TCS employee
				   			  3) My experiences
				   			  Based on the above, my pay should have been like: $120K in 10/2018
				   			  But due to the following factors, I think that my pay could be: $115-120K in 10/2018:
				   			  1) Bench-time factor
				   			  2) ...
				   [Someone]: then why did you get $100K?
				   [Jerry]:   Some other reasons: some were ok, and some were not so right/accurate:
				   			  1) They didn't review and treat me completely with my experiences when extending the offer, and I didn't negotiate either
				   			  2) They treated me as an experienced engineer but not assigned the same level client duties: Citibank, CoreLogic, etc.
				   			  3) Some of the TCS clients: belong to various job duties, including app/prod support work types (which should be lower pays than developers) 
				   			  4) TCS has its own internal ranking systems, so if you are not get right pays when hired, then you gotta climb up the promotion/annual ladders
				   [Someone]: How do you think about TCS-FM-L3 folks and their pays?
				   [Jerry]:   Overall, all TCS employees' pays are company-wide scenarios, not directly related to one client like TCS-FM-L3
				   			  So all the L3 employees' pays are from their TCS ranks and hire-agreement..., 
				   			  	one client is just providing their performance reviews and adding one more client duties into their resume as work type, tech etc.
				   [Someone]: How do you think about their pays?
				   [Jerry]:   Like I said, their pays are based on TCS overall rank systems, not due to FM-L3 duties or client-scenario
				   			  (how do you know about each one's ranks? 1) line management ... 2) TCS bands (like: Jerry is: C3A), ...3) ...
				   			  Example:
				   			  	Manish Kumar: his TCS rank is above me, so his band is above C3A, and (generally speaking) his pay is above me, ...
				   			  				  [My estimate]: his salary is: $110-115K
				   			  	Sudhir Menon: [My estimate]: his salary is: $125K
				   			  	Rahul:		  [My estimate]: his salary is: $110K
				   			  	Shiv:		  [My estimate]: his salary is: $110K
				   			  	Mahesh:		  [My estimate]: his salary is: $105K
				   			  	Hari:		  [My estimate]: his salary is: $105K
				   			  	Bil:		  [My estimate]: his salary is: $100K
				   			  	Eskinder:	  [My estimate]: his salary is: $98K
				   			  	Harish:		  [My estimate]: his salary is: $95K
				   			  	Yogesh:	  	  [My estimate]: his salary is: $92K
				   			  	Chinju:		  [My estimate]: his salary is: $85K
				   			  	Vamsi:		  [My estimate]: his salary is: $85K
				   			  	Steven:		  [My estimate]: his salary is: $80K				   			  	
				   [Someone]: then one more question, why don't you get a pay raise this year?
				   [Jerry]:   First of all, I am not sure if I don't get a pay raise at all this year until June 2021 paycheck.
				   			  Here is my TCS pay raises over the past 2 years:
				   			  1) 10/2018: 100K plus $5000 bonus statement
				   			  2) 06/2019: 104K? (bonus didn't get verified ... to my knowledge)
				   			  			  Performance band: B
				   			  3) 06/2020: 107K? (bonus didn't get verified ... to my knowledge)
				   			  			  Performance band: D ==>Mostly due to Fedex work scenarios
				   			  4) 06/2021: Unknown
				   			  			  Performance band: C ==>Mostly due to my work/life balances scenarios + some unfair scenarios
				   			  			  (My side evaluation: should be B)
				   	[Someone]: You mentioned that your TCS salary should be close to 115K-120K, why are you still ok with 107K?
				   	[Jerry]:   Like some of the above reasons:
				   			   1) TCS is No.1 India IT service company with some stability in terms of clients domains
				   			   2) TCS: bench time pays (at least over my past clients experiences)
				   			   3) TCS: multiple types of clients and client work types: this multiplicity also gives me flexibility of pay ranges
				   			   4) I enable some of my own initiatives:
				   			   		==>Life/work life balances
				   			   		==>2nd work incomes
				   			   		==>Independent Contributor work aspects
				   			   		==>Team-specialist work aspects:
				   			   			==>Such as: worked to some degree as L3-specialist in TCS-FM-L3 team and work tasks
				   			   		==>At this time, keeping and having TCS client work and focusing on technical scenarios 
				   			   			are somewhat more useful and important to me than below parts:
				   			   			==>Significant pay raises
				   			   			==>Promotion
				   			   			==>Become a TCS line manager: like Manish or Prabhu
				   			   			==>Super good in Ultimatix iEvolve courses and/or certifications
				   			   			==>...
