Self Working Patterns
***********************

(1) Procedures/Patterns:
	1) Records:
		==>Needed
		==>PROS:
			==>INFO/Needs: Pre-Stage/Prehand/In-Advance
			==>INFO/Needs: Ongoing
			==>INFO/Needs: Post-Stage
			==>INFO/Needs: Issues/Repair/Fix/Responsibilities/Tracing/Troubleshooting
		==>CONS:
		
(2) Procedures/Patterns: Tasking/TaskEstimates
	1) Task Estimates:
		==>Utilize: Estimate/Analysis "Five Main Principles" Guide

(3) Procedures/Patterns: Teams Work
	1) Team Engagements:
		==>L3: Engagement with Dev Team: normal and nothing wrong
		==>Engagement Methods:
			==>1) Meetings
			==>2) MS-Teams Calls
			==>3) MS-Teams Chats
			==>4) SN - Tickets
			==>5) Emails
	2) Team Work:
		==>PROS:
			==>Nature 1: Problem Resolution: needs
			==>Nature 2: Enterprise / Corporate teams: buildup/enablement
						 ==>These team ecosystems: determine how many problems get resolved
			==>...
		==>CONS:
		
		
		
(9) Procedures/Patterns:	
	1) Working Styles: GO Players? or Just Special Styles? or Actually Common Sense Styles?
		==>Example: 
		==>Example: Deep-and-not-mentioning styles:
					Example: Mahesh: not mentioning his 2 other changes in the chat
		==>Example: 
		==>Example: Sounds/Looks helping others mainly or solely: but actually belong to his main duties
					Example: Mahesh helped the CHG: deployed Justin's changes: 90%
							 1) He is POC1 for SPARTA and this is not related to SM data migration directly
		==>Example: Sounds/Looks helping others mainly or solely: but actually add some self-needs or based on self-needs
					Example: Mahesh helped the CHG: deployed Justin's changes: 80%
							 1) He has 2 other changes
		==>Example: Sounds/Looks helping others mainly or solely: but actually belong to "take easy credits because it is simple change"
					Example: Mahesh helped the CHG: deployed Justin's changes: 33%
							 1) It may still take some efforts/8pm for CHG ticket, but overall very straightforward and simple
		==>Example: 
		==>Example: 
	2) Working Styles: Handle "difficult to work with":
		==>Example: Except some good/needed communications: dealing with "difficult to work with" (both yourself and others):
					==>"Not becoming too talkative"
					==>"Sometimes quite/silent": actually being better
					==>"Sometime miss some emails?/chats?": reasonable if 
						==>you are really busy
						==>really don't know how to respond
						==>really no need to respond immediately
					==>Exceptions: fight against abusers...
		==>Example: "Difficult to work with" Scenario: Not happy/accept "Team/Manager/Coworker-enabled extra work time": but ok with "Self-enabled extra work time"
					==>Example 1: GMC-IT-Technologist Jerry:
								  ==>How to deal with Jerry
								  ==>How does Jerry deals with others
								  Unfair Facts:
								  	==>In year 2020:
								  		==>Pandemic/CCPVirus
								  		==>No fixed office areas and WIFI
								  		==>New to L3
								  		==>No cozy living room, TV, kitcken, and refrigerator at 10:00pm EDT on Fridays
					==>
		==>Example:

		==>Example:
	
	
(15) Procedures/Patterns:	
	1) Working Styles: 3-type-super-good/tough resources/styles?
		==>Example: 
		
		
		==>Enablements:
			==>Talks
			==>Keys/Paths/Solutions
			==>Balanced Schedules

(16) Procedures/Patterns:	
	1) Working Styles: Enemies (and useful sometimes)
		==>Example: Emails

(18) Procedures/Patterns:	
	1) Working Styles: Sometimes: open to listen to others' technical views - even you know some
		==>Example: Google Map API and API Keys
		However:
			==>Over the past experiences:
			   [60%]: Jerry was right
			   [30%]: Online Documentations
			   [10%]: Only 10% from others:
			   			1) Due to not sharing, or not willing to share 
			   			2) Most of them are not better than "Online Official Documentations" 
			   			3) Jerry has had 18-year experiences, ...
