IT Task: Case Study: Summaries:

===========================================
Solutions/Methods Summary:

(1) Use: Principle:	Real/Fair/Actual Estimates:
		==>Be professional
		==>Be neutral:		==>No need to use purchase/market price bargaining ways
							==>No need to use negotiation ways
		==>My part: use the above principles:
			==>What others think is their issues or problems...: 1) they discuss their feedbacks in the real technical parts, it is welcome 2) being personal, it is their problems
		==>One bottom line:
			==>Estimates based on solution-analysis + average-time on them...: this is the estimates from you
			==>And Jerry welcomes others to provide feedbacks and/or their solution-analysis + LOE

(2) Methodology Aspects: Solutions and Methods:
		==>Method 1: Concurrent-Analysis-Solutions
					 ==>Do in-meeting evaluations using the following analysis portfolios
		==>Method 2: Background-Analysis-Readiness Solutions
					 ==>Background Analysis: set up a meeting + do pre-meeting evaluations using the following analysis portfolios
		==>Method 3: Combined-Concurrent-And-Background-Analysis Solutions
		
		Analysis:
			==>Point 1: Do task-solution analysis:
						==>module/processing/data/tools/integration/etc analysis
			==>Point 2: Do capacity analysis
						==>data and data size
						==>data design and complexities
						==>...
			==>Point 3: Do procedures and stages analysis:
						==>DEV/SIT
						==>UAT
						==>PROD
			==>Point 4: Do schedules analysis: your current workloads + ...
			==>Point 5: Optional: Do performance/resources/... analysis
			==>Point 6: Then come up with estimates
		
(3) Psychological Aspects: Solutions and Methods:
		==>If unsure about capacity and analysis and estimates, ask for a time to evaulate and set up a meeting
		==>Handle pressures
		==>  						
			  						
(4) Communication Aspects: Solutions and Methods:
		==>Do better communications
		==>Utilize previous work and task sessions:
			==>I may not be completely right or completely wrong
			==>So do others...
				Example 1: including the work items with Mahesh
				...
		==>
				
(5) Personality/Weakness/Actual-Stupidity Aspects: Solutions and Methods:
		==>1) Avoid: show how good or quick you are compared with others:
			==>This is wrong basically
			==>Most of companies work on procedures and processing: including Agile, DEV/SIT/UAT/PROD...
			==>Standards:
				==>Same team comparison
				==>Same task type comparison
				==>The task itself's natures and analysis
				==>...
		==>2) Avoid: pointless passions or excitement or wrong feelings
			==>Work natures: mostly neutral and professional
			==>Normal work: mostly good work - just see all other coworkers and other teams, and those on the bridge...
		==>3) Normal/neutral/balanced and "Real/Fair/Actual Estimates" ways
		==>All scenarios:
			==>Nothing perfect
			==>All have PROS and CONS: especially CONS
			==>The 3)-Way "Being neutral and normal ways" have more PROS and less CONS for you than the above 1)+2):
				More PROS:
					==>Health/exercises
					==>Life/work balances
					==>...
				Less CONS:
					==>Many more issues if using the above 1)+2) than 3):
						==>Example 1: Cause your health and personal issues in various scenarios...
						==>Example 2: In the long run and real world: doing 1)+2) would cause more work/job security and rights issues: actually jeopardize your work/job security
					==>...
						
			==>If not doing 1)+2), but doing 3): cause your work/job security and rights issue:
				==>Then it is some others' abuse issues
				==>Not your issues

===========================================
Mistakes:

	==>Mistake 1:	"Psychologically weakened aspects in IT workplaces and working scenarios"
		==>
	==>Mistake 2: 
		==>Didn't say: "I am in the middle of some items, can I review it and set up a meeting this afternoon
						to discuss with you about the evaluations and estimates? Can you invite business user for this need?
						If we can add dev team to the meeting, it would be even better."
	
	==>Mistake 3:	Technical Areas
	
	==>Mistake 4:		
	
===========================================
Analysis:

==>Analysis 1: 	
	[Mahesh]: Hi GM, ...
	[Jerry]:  Hi morning...
	[Mahesh]: ...sending the file
	[Jerry]:  (
				Jerry was busy with some other tickets at that time, and also afraid of Mahesh's scenarios a little bit
				Instinctly, Jerry was not interested in working on his items due to previous tasks' issues from him
				[Someones]: What issues were from previous tasks with him?
				[Jerry]: several issues - see below:
						 1) Abuser side: he did show some Livilly's abusing scenarios or resemblance
						 2) Difficult Aspect 1: he didn't do coding, so all items with his SPPARTA/MSS would be me or Ravinder, so we were busy..., 
						 						==>Especially when you had work with other 5-10 apps, then it would be a nightmare...
						 						[Someones]: so you think Mahesh didn't do anything good to you?
						 						[Jerry]: not really, he did something good to me below:
						 								 1) His SPARTA/MSS work (when I was pre POC2) helped me with some meaningful workloads when I was not so busy
						 								 2) He did communicate sometimes, even though not perfectly
						 3) Difficult Aspect 2: he did have some scenarios or expected me to work during the entire evening or overnight
						 		(at least I worried about it during these times:
						 			because I was not SPARTA/MSS POC any more, and I was kind of busy with other apps plus Ravinder was POC2 at that time, ...
						 			so I didn't tend to work for his items during evening or weekends,
						 			and as an example: there was one time: he worked for PROD deployment and I worked for UAT deployment, 
						 				and I didn't tell him to join his PROD deployment,
						 			and another example was the reports generation for MSS: I was somewhat hesitated due to the concerns of prolonged time into evening
						 				and he didn't tell me that he was able to do 3 chunk data division to generate the reports on his side
						 			also I kept worrying about his intentions to get me busy on purpose due to his behalf of Livilly's retaliation needs,
						 			As an overall summary:
						 				- his Livilly representation and possible retaliation in terms of making me busy on purpose
						 				- his not involved in coding and purely function as a POC business handler to BOS/BusinessUsers, which made me stuck in his tasks
						 					without his sufficient help (during these items: he didn't provide sufficient task info and for sure no coding side help at all,
						 					or even no project direction info like Tom Nolan, which was not so right because he was 5-year SPARTA/MSS POC, and he was supposed
						 					to provide task direction and "solution analysis" even though not involved in coding, this didn't make sense.
						 					To make this more understandable: if I was 5-year POC for some app, I was able to provide key solution analysis with any POC2/3 when
						 					they work on any tasks for these apps)
						 					==>This shows that he lacks the core POC1 leadership and Tom Nolan's style solution technical stacks (even non-coding side)
						 						==>He is unable to provide some guidance or technical solution directions - aka: everything is almost on my own
						 							(This SM Data Migration: he did a little bit better alongside the processes...
						 								Examples: ...)
						 				- his not provide sufficient task information sometimes... cannot take excuses of saying Jerry didn't ask, ...
						 4) Difficult Aspect 3: handling business users using extreme ends instead of balanced ways:
						 		==>He basically completely stayed me away from the user side: this is fine for him to be the main POC contact to business users
						 			- this can save my communication time, or avoid some communication problems/issues, etc.
						 			However, for special scenarios, he didn't bootstrap it:
						 				Example 1: when he talked to me about this task: he didn't initiate a meeting together with Justin with me ...
						 					he didn't give me time to evaluate...
						 					he didn't know about this task's scope as a 5-year POC1
						 			Due to this task size, he did let Justin to talk to me directly, which was actually correct, ...
						 5) Difficult Aspect 4: he might have discussed with Sudhir in some bad-mouthing ways...
						 		==>Not spend more time in his tasks
						 		==>Not willing to work during evenings and weekends for his tasks even though he hinted me 
						 			(in my sense: more like 
						 				1) Livilly's retaliation, 
						 				2) inappropriate demandings to me as a pre-POC2,
						 				3) kinda of shakening my work/life balances to work for a non-POC app tasks,
						 				4) Why did not Mahesh address or involve me better when business side pressures were applied?
						 					==>Such as: you got these reports: why gave me so short time?
						 						and I was not MSS POC any more, and there were some app technical unknowns because of MSS/SPARTA are large apps
						 			)
						 		==>His words might have involved Sudhir to rebuff/intimidate me for at least one time:...
						 			(the above reports work scenario)
						 			Sudhir told me that I could release you from L3 if you wanted to...
				[Someones]: Seems like some issues, then how did you respond to him?
				[Jerry]: I was indeed busy at that time, I told him that I would take a look into at 11:00am
				...
				[Jerry]: Then I took at a very quick look at the Excel file, and something reminded me of his previous reports work, and I was really want Vamsi to work on it
						 because I thought he had become POC2 like Ravinder, why not he continued Ravinder's role and do this task...
						 Based on the check of the Excel file, I knew it was some Java code to generate the queries but didn't know about any of the following difficulties:
						 	1) do UPSERT
						 		but I did know it was possible to use similar function and tokens I used for Borrower and Borrower Principals, etc,
						 		but didn't think about using: not exists
						 		Also wondered why the previous Borrower and Borrower Principals were not used, ...
						 		[This was just an example about 60-70% of time Mahesh didn't do communication well]
						 	2) Data Size:
						 		Also didn't think about the size of the data, and this caused many issues:
						 			1) Running time: 2 hour to run one time...: this was one reason why the first week was busy but not so enabled to build up test flows...
						 			2) ...
						 			3) Many exceptions during the DEV/UAT testing
						 	3) More code changes:
						 		Didn't know the DCU tool needed to be changed
						 	4) Data complexities:
						 		Didn't know some difficulties with the fields and their complexities...
						 	5) App Logic/Business Models:
						 		Didn't know which tables I needed to insert/update...
						 		Didn't know the involved tables except deal table: didn't know the table secr at all...
						 		(had to analyze these tables completely: size, types, non-null, have to go through all these tables: a lot of time...)
						 		Didn't know the DB tables for this, so lack info to build up data patterns (understand data in Excel as well) and create test flows, etc.
						 		(bonds tables were completely new to me)
						 	6) Env and Test Flows:
						 		Not existing to me:
						 		==>UAT DB, dev box, how to test UAT UI, ...
						 		==>Even using MSSQL Management Studio: validate and/or run queries... - size (Mahesh helped it at this time...)
						 		....
				[Someones]: how did Mahesh respond to you?
				[Jerry]: He said that Vamsi was not for that...
						 But I was really not interested in it mostly due to not POC for SPARTA/MSS plus worried about this task's doubts
						 and also I was just in the on-call/healthcheck dual shifts
						 I remember that I mentioned: why not having dev team doing it?
						 Mahesh said: no, he didn't think dev team could do this
						 Then I thought that I did need to take a look into it, but I got the following issues when I was ready to work on it...
						 1) evaluation and meeting:
						 	==>During the call with Mahesh and Vamsi at 11:00am: I didn't mention: I need to evaluate it and come up with some estimates
						 	   [Jerry]: Since Vamsi and dev team cannot do it, and you want me to do it, I do need to conduct some evaluation on this task
						 	   			By the way, Mahesh, I do think this is a task instead of a simple business user side support scenario
						 	   [Mahesh]: Jerry, I think you didn't understand what L3 work really means:
						 	   			L3 work is always supporting business user to be running fine and immediately resolve their issues as soon as possible
						 	   			same for this need
						 	   [Jerry]: I understand what L3 work means, but this one does seem to be different, and it is more like a dev task, which is why I
						 	   			did check with you about Vamsi and dev team availability because it is different from normal L3 support issues
						 	   [Mahesh]: Like I said, L3 work is to support and resolve any business user issues in a timely manner, ...
						 	   			if you don't understand this need, I can have business manager call you
						 	   [Jerry]: that is fine, can I set up a meeting this afternoon to come up with some estimates like 3pm, is this fine?
						 	   [Mahesh]: 3pm? (I would say that based on the business user needs, by 3pm this issue should be already done, ...)
						 	   			Just to be honest, this issue could be urgent, ...
						 	   [Jerry]: Urgent? can you elaborate why it is urgent instead of a simple data migration? Is their production app down? or?
						 	   			Also if it is urgent, why didn't business users contact you in a planning scenario so L3 can accommodate and support
						 	   			their issues based on better schedules?
						 	   			Or if they did sync up with you about L3 support need in a scheduled scenarios, you should have involved me earlier so
						 	   			I can prepare my work with supported schedules
						 	   [Mahesh]: ok then, 3pm we can have a meeting to discuss about estimates...
						 	   (What Jerry did was like: the actual conversations during the 11:00am meeting:
						 	   		[Jerry]: ok, if Vamsi and dev team are not for this, I can work on it...
						 	   				 it is like a Java code, which may be similar to previous borrower query generator...
						 	   		[Mahesh]: Java? fine, can you get it done soon? (I didn't exactly remember what he said here...)
						 	   				(Overall here: his tones and words pushed me to some degree...: I forgot how he said...)
						 	   				(due to his pushing scenarios: I was even hesitated to say 2 days because my psychological feeling was:
						 	   					he expected me to get it done tomorrow ...
						 	   					==>Didn't he know about this task's scope?
						 	   					==>Didn't I know about this task's scope?
						 	   					Were we all morons? or fools?
						 	   					At that time, on my mind it was about 1 day to get it done or 2-day to get it done...
						 	   					Actually I chose to say 2-day
						 	   				)
						 	   		[Jerry]: I could try to work on it and maybe get it ready with 2 days if there are no blockers..., 
						 	   				 but I will see if there are some issues..., it could be based on previous borrower module, but the data are different this time, ...
						 	   		...
						 	   		[Mahesh]: ..., ok, that is fine...
						 	   		...
						 	   		[Jerry]: I will create an IT service ticket for this work
						 	   		...
						 	   		[Mahesh]: (here is the only meaningful or genuine or helpful words from him for this task)
						 	   				  No need to create the IT service ticket, ..., because I think it will break up SLA if you create an IT service ticket
						 	   		[Jerry]:  Breaking up SLA? no, IT service ticket is for 5 days...
						 	   		
						 	   	(Then I created an IT Service ticket..., and tried to see the borrower module could be used quickly for this excel file
						 	   		..., but there were many items different...
						 	   )
						 	   Ideally, we have a 3pm meeting...
						 	   [Jerry]: Mahesh, I think we should invite business users, who are they? this is like a triage call
						 	   			More importantly, I have done some preliminary analysis, and come up with some estimates here
						 	   [Mahesh]: Analysis? estimates? I thought you should be almost done with it now...
						 	   [Jerry]: Not like this at all, based on my analysis, this task is actually like a dev work, instead of normal L3 support work item
						 	   			1) I have analyzed the Excel file, the file size and data are completely different from borrower module
						 	   				that module cannot be used directly for this new excel and datasets
						 	   			2) There are significant code module buildup and changes required for this task
						 	   [Mahesh]: are you sure? then it would just add several days, right?
						 	   [Jerry]: This task should follow the normal PROD deployment flows because of its large data size and PROD deployment could incur some risks
						 	   			due to this large data size.
						 	   			Also the normal PROD deployment flows should involve DEV/SIT and UAT deployment processes before PROD processes
						 	   			These factors should be all included into the entire analysis and estimates.
						 	   			Without these processes, PROD deployment is too risky
						 	   [Mahesh]: En, business user side expects this to be done as soon as possible, they prefer this week
						 	   [Jerry]: Like I said, it needs to go through DEV/SIT and UAT deployment processes.
						 	   			PROD deployment is not possible without these processes plus its large data size causing some risks to PROD apps.
						 	   			If you really need some quick solutions, we can provide estimates for UAT env deployment first, but I prefer to have entire
						 	   			estimates for PROD deployment
						 	   			(At that time: actually Jerry didn't think about PROD deployment, because:
						 	   				1) Borrower module was aborted and went nowhere, and in my mind I thought this would be the same...
						 	   				2) Because of borrower module scenario, I was even thinking about its joking aspect...
						 	   					==>So when later on Justin mentioned PROD deployment, I was surprised and ...
						 	   						==>After I realized Justin being serious about PROD deployment, I became more serious as well...
						 	   				3) Also the large data size, due to the large data size, it gave me doubts about feasibility of PROD deployment
						 	   			)
						 	   			By the way, I sent an email before the meeting with the estimates, can you check?
						 	   			BTW, here is the screen print about my estimates
						 	   	[Mahesh]: Let me check, 3 weeks?
						 	   	[Jerry]: this is based on my current workloads, I am on-call plus also doing health check work. I also have had some other apps' work ongoing
						 	   			So I have provided estimates from 03/29 through 04/16
						 	   	[Mahesh]: it is just some simple queries generated by Java, right?
						 	   	[Jerry]: its data size is large, and also the data tables are unfamiliar to me.
						 	   	[Mahesh]: I sent you some sample table updates...
						 	   	[Jerry]: Right, but these data are completely different from borrower / borrower principals, so I cannot simply reuse the same code
						 	   			My estimates consider and include the normal PROD deployment flows, so I added DEV/SIT deployment date, and UAT dates
						 	   			Without these testing and deployment processes, we cannot do PROD deployment
						 	   			By the way, is this task only for providing RCA to business users? or L3 analysis for feasibility?
						 	   	[Mahesh]: seems like they need actual PROD DB migration, but I may need to check with the business side
						 	   	[Jerry]: If you are not so sure, can we set up another meeting tomorrow to add business users for a triage call
						 	   			to understand the scopes better and provide formal estimates to all stakeholders for this task?
						 	   			Also can you forward me some of the emails from business users for this task?
						 	   			One more point is: adding business users to the call would help synchronize the estimates with them about this task.
						 	   	[Mahesh]: What are the estimated time that I should talk to business users?
						 	   	[Jerry]: Can we invite them into the call or tomorrow's meeting to discuss these estimates together instead of provide estimates
						 	   			 simply like this way?
						 	    [Mahesh]: I would rather send them some information right now by me
						 	    [Jerry]: I can provide some estimates to you to forward to them, but anyways I will set up a meeting tomorrow morning to keep everyone
						 	    		 on the same page about this task. Please send me the business users email regarding this request.
						 	    		 I will work on some module right now as well and conduct more thorough analysis.
						 	   			 You can tell business users about its Java module needs and its large data size plus DEV/SIT and UAT env deployment stages and dates.
						 	   			 Currently my estimates on my email should be fine, which is 03/29 through 04/16.
						 	   			
						 	   	on Wednesday, 03/31/2021: Jerry set up another meeting:	
						 	   	[Jerry]: Mahesh, I have found out we might need running multiple sql files, so we need to modify the current DCU tool,
						 	   			 this would add some more time estimates due to this DCU tool changes
						 	   	[Mahesh]: more time? business users will not understand, and it is hard for me to extend more time to talk to them
						 	   	[Jerry]: I have run some query generation and it involves 20000+ queries, and a sql file with more than 20000 queries will lead to some
						 	   			 DB table lock scenarios, so multiple sql files may need to be processed. So DCU tool needs to be modified.
						 	   	[Mahesh]: modifying the DCU tool?
						 	   	[Jerry]: yes
						 	   	[Mahesh]: are you sure the DB table lock was due to the large set of sql queries in one file instead of the query errors?
						 	   	[Jerry]: Good question, but currently it is unavailable to verify this until all logic is done plus the all the queries are validated
						 	   			 But the estimates may need to be adjusted if DCU tool needs to be changed
						 	   	[Mahesh]: This is against L3 support to business user scenarios ... it is hard to explain to business side
						 	   	[Jerry]: In nature this task belongs to dev team
						 	   	[Mahesh]: No, it belongs to L3 team, dev team won't do it
						 	   	[Jerry]: Why doesn't dev team do it?
						 	   	[Mahesh]: L3 should also involve break-fix work (but not including me)
						 	   	[Jerry]: Are you sure this task will go to PROD deployment? the large data sets seem to me that it is not easy to update so many PROD DB tables
						 	   	[Mahesh]: ... (I am not really sure) (this is another plausibly genuine words from Mahesh...)
						 	   	[Jerry]: ...
						 	   	
						 	   	(Jerry was busy with on-call and health check work plus other meetings						 	   		
						 	   	
						 	   	(1 week: Jerry pushed hard to get something running and made it working...
						 	   		==>But failed to push forward with the first week when Friday comes... and Saturday dawning...
						 	   		==>But through the first week work, Jerry realized that it was beyond the simple work ...
						 	   		==>Jerry adjusted the work estimates on his side
						 	   			by talking to Justin directly, Jerry gained more info ...
						 	   			but slowed down to think about its feasibility with PROD, and only thinking about UAT, ...
						 	   	...
						 	   			
						 	   	04/07/2021: Jerry's on-call was eventually done: Jerry got serious about Hari's updates on xMatters...
						 	   	04/09/2021: Jerry's morning health check work was done as well: ..., so Jerry's morning got released between 6am-9am
						 	   		(because 8am-9am: Jerry still wrapped up some items...)
								2-3 week Transition sessions still went on...: ate up most of Jerry's afternoon time...
								some apps work...
								some meetings...
									==>One of the meetings: Jerry didn't know it was so related so didn't pay attention to: MF Bonds Proxy Service...
								Then Jerry kept spending his time in the evenings and weekends to get this task going...
						 	   			
						 	   	During the 2-4 week work on this, more issues showed up and blockers...
						 	   	...
						 	   			
						 2) under some pressures, I didn't use common methodologies and healthy psychological ways and also anti-abuse/anti-unfairness scenartios:
						 	==>
						 3) 
			  )
			  
			  
			  			==>Summaries: better
			  				==>Do not provide estimates via Teams Chat and the short meeting in the morning at 11:00am
			  					==>Fighting Point 1: during the chat/short-meeting: feel intimidated or nervous with Mahesh's pressures?
			  						==>This is first issue/challenge Jerry has had... ==>Also for any future tasks... and for anyone else other than Mahesh
			  						(key 1: if you don't use real/fair estimates, situations are worse: so you will see that this is just a better way...: so you will do this fair ways../)
			  						(...
			  					==>Fighting Point 2: during the chat/short-meeting: communications...
			  						==>Discussions itself is a result...
			  					==>Fighting Point 3: during the chat/short-meeting: try to show how quick I could do the work due to some personal weaknesses?
			  						(key 1: if you are not doing normally balanced or reasonable ways: you could become sick, or even impacting
			  								many of your personal life scenarios...: so you don't need to become too aggressive...)
			  						(...
			  						==>This is basically wrong:
			  							Solution: just based on what the REAL work / items / task is up to: (focus on the work natures instead of who you are)
			  									  ==>This is only fix and solution to Jerry's weakness
			  									  ==>Issues with Mahesh(others) or job security?
			  									  	 ==>Mostly it can be addressed: aka: no concerns: if you don't do this way, you could have more concerns...
			  									  	 Analysis 1:
			  									  	 	[Mahesh]: ok, you cannot do it? I give this to others...
			  									  	 	[Jerry]: this is purely based on the work analysis and come up with estimates, nothing personal
			  									  	 			 (by the way, a lot of people provide buffered estimates
			  									  	 			 	because they are not interested and use them as an excuse..., right?)
			  									  	 			 (no, a lot of people are not using this as an excuse, instead they do human-world
			  									  	 			  negotiation process: so the other side can cut it down, and eventually
			  									  	 			  reach the real fairness: which is in the middle ...
			  									  	 			  Without buffered time, negotiation logic won't work...
			  									  	 			  	because the other side also use the same human world negotiation logic and will start from your time
			  									  	 			  	point and move it down to the middle and that middle is favoring them, ...
			  									  	 			  	so to make negotiation principle work, just like price bargaining, you need to supply some buffered time
			  									  	 			  	to let the other side do their cut-down...
			  									  	 			 [Someones] but Agile methods and IT work estimates is not like price bargaining, right?
			  									  	 			 [Jerry]: right, should be. Which is why I provide real estimates based on the real needs and work natures
			  									  	 			 	based on analysis. It is the same ways I have done to deal with CCP, FCP, LiviCom, YiviCom, and abusers
			  									  	 			 	based on the entire truth.
			  									  	 Anyways, the real solution for Jerry to overcome this weakness is: do REAL work / items / task analysis and estimates
			  									  	 	and do not feel any intimidation or concerns from the others...
			  									  	 	==>If you are not sure about the estimates, say: set up a meeting or in the afternoon...
			  									  	 		and do an analysis and provide estimates
			  									  	 	Worried about losing work or job?
			  									  	 		==>Compared with this, doing this estimates is "better" (less risky and less dangerous...) than the above concern
			  									  	 		==>Aka: there is no such a thing that is perfect and no concerns, just "better"
			  				==>Set up a meeting at 3pm: provide initial estimates based on preliminary analysis: which is: 3 weeks: 03/29-04/16
			  					==>List items
			  					==>>Focus on natures of this task
			  				==>Adjust more estimates when new issues or blockers are identified and encountered
			  				==>


						Estimates: it is on its own domain:
							It is overall analysis scenarios
							Jerry's estimates ways should use Jerry's normal ways:
								1) Write-down analysis way:
									==>Works for analysis and estimates...
									==>It might not work for inside-meeting quick analysis/estimate...
										But if Jerry lacks this ability or stronger personality-related scenarios, then Jerry tries to do personal-time analysis/estimate scenario
										==>Will try to practice inside-meeting quick analysis/estimate, but sometimes some analysis needs some time...
										
										inside-meeting quick analysis/estimate:
											==>break down modules...
											==>Utilize procedures: dev/sit, uat, ...
											
										Modules -> Stages -> ... do not immediately talk about days... (no need to come to hours, ...)
										
								2) ...
						Blockers are another domain

	
						"I am in the middle of some items, can I review it and set up a meeting this afternoon
						to discuss with you about the evaluations and estimates? Can you invite business user for this need?
						If we can add dev team to the meeting, it would be even better."

==>Summarize 4 Scenarios: When Dealing With IT Tasks and IT Coworkers/Management:

	Scenario 1: Urgent Scenarios: 20%
				==>Point 1: Urgent Scenarios: Do Happen in IT World/Tasks/Coworkers/Management
				==>Point 2: Urgent Scenarios: Need to Be "Real"
											  ==>Not the following "NonReal" Scenarios:
											  	 1) Abuser-Enabled
											  	 2) Management: extra-needs/unreasonable-needs/strategies/goals/... enabled or empowered or driven or demanded
											  	 3) Coworker: extra-needs/unreasonable-needs/strategies/goals/... enabled or empowered or driven or demanded
											  	 4) Company Ignored/Neglected:
											  	 	==>Procedures/Solutions:
											  	 		No procedures/solutions to be discussed and enabled to deal with it
											  	 	==>Enhancements:
											  	 		No enhancements to be added to reduce/minimize/optimize it
											  	 	==>Fairness:
											  	 		No fairness measures to be checked and enabled
											  	 		Examples:
											  	 			==>No fair shifts
											  	 				==>Example 1: Manish
											  	 			==>No fair work duties combo:
											  	 				==>Example 1: Enable TCS-FM-L3 duties as a combo of "core-8-hours + extra-hours + no-shifts"
											  	 					Aka:
											  	 						1) it requires L3: work weekdays: 8-core-hours
											  	 						2) it requires L3: work during evenings and weekends:
											  	 										   ==>Without clear/explicit (except possibly implicit/self-guided) team guidelines/instructions about "allowing OOO or non-benefit-program-sick-days"
											  	 						3) it requires L3: take on-call and POC-calls 24-hour timeframes without normal-8hour-shifts like BEAM-MF and GOC teams
											  	 				==>Example 2: Enable TCS-FM-L3 duties as a combo: smoke-validation-tests + "business/QA-functionality-validation-tests(such as someones do it on his/her own initiatives)"
											  	 				==>Example 3: Enable TCS-FM-L3 duties as a combo: some resources: non-code specialists + some resources: code-specialist (example: break-fixes CHG)
											  	 5) Personalized: Personal-Targeted
				==>Point 3: Urgent Scenarios: Need to be "Intervaled/NonFrequent/Reasonable/Justified/Method-Handled/Solution-Enhanced"
				
	Scenario 2: Normal Scenarios: 78%
				==>This comprises majority of work items and scenarios

	Scenario 3: Self-Moron Scenarios: 1%:
				==>Should be limited to 1%

	Scenario 4: Ignore Scenarios: 1%:
				==>Should be limited to 1%
				(but this doesn't include: legitimate-ignoring scenarios to ensure: some rights/anti-abuses/anti-mistreatment/performance/work-life-balances/etc.
