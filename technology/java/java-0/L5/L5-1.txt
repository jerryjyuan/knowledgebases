Java APIs:
	==>URL:
		(space character) is changed to %20
		==>Solution:
			URI uri = path.toURI();
			File file = new File(uri);
			More:
				URI uri = url.toURI(); FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(uri.getPath());
			URI is the bridge:
				File file = new File("/Users/work space/tempFile.txt");
				URL url = file.toURI().toURL();
	==>Class.getResource vs. Classloader.getResource:
		Class.getResource: can take a "relative" resource name, which is treated relative to the class's package.
			Alternatively you can specify an "absolute" resource name by using a leading slash. 
		Classloader.getResource: resource paths are always deemed to be absolute
		==>I have reasoned these many times
		==>Right now: just need to get the keys to memorize it forever
			1) Key 1: it is both about classpath...: all/both are getting resources from classpath
			2) Key 2: Class has class's package concept, so it takes both relative and absolute paths | ClassLoader only able to find via absolute
		
	==>Multiple APIs: may not be exactly equal:
		==>Sometimes make a difference
			StreamSource(File f)
			StreamSource(InputStream inputStream)		
		==>Sometimes: Some APIs have more usage: such as: Source[], ...
			abstract Schema	newSchema(Source[] schemas)
			
	==>Enable simple way to process multiple XSD files into Source[]:	
		private static StreamSource[] generateStreamSourcesFromXsdPathsJdk8(  
		   final String[] xsdFilesPaths)  
		{  
		   return Arrays.stream(xsdFilesPaths)  
		                .map(StreamSource::new)  
		                .collect(Collectors.toList())  
		                .toArray(new StreamSource[xsdFilesPaths.length]);  
		}  

	==>Validate an XML document by using DTD, XDR, or XSD
		Microsoft XML-Data Reduced (XDR) schema
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/dotnet/visual-basic/validate-xml-document-by-dtd-xdr-xsd
		
	==>Java Virtual Machine specification, the code of a method must not be bigger than 65536 bytes
		65536 = 256 x 256
		==>65536/100
		==>6553 lines
