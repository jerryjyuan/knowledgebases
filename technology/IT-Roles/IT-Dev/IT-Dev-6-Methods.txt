Dev/Work: Methods


========================================================
Method: TDD

========================================================
Method:	xxx-Through

	==>xxx-Through:
		==>Core-Through: flow/data/...
		
	==>

========================================================
Method: Test Methods/Flows: Enabled

==>Example: MSS SM-Migration

========================================================
Method: Work on Business Logic:

==>Use better ways/tools/...:
	Sometimes: no mixed coding ways
	==>Query: not coding inside Java app
	==>Notepad or Studio: ...: then add to Java code file...

==>


========================================================
Method: Better Scheduling/Estimates/...

==>Communications
	==>
==>Methods

==>Procedures Enabled:
	==>Agile/Scrum/PI Meetings:
		==>Due to its common-ways and fairness: mostly not get abused
				==>Managers talked to leads: for pre-discussions and plannings
				==>Engineers: should do some pre-research as well to know these stories better and prepare for scrum meeting
				==>During the meetings: everyone can have a say...
			Good Examples:
				==>Trion World: during the meeting, everyone raised a card with estimates: managers take averages as estimates for each one
				==>Worldpay: PI meetings are fair but Rama might not be...
				==>Teradata: Waterfall models: the ways from Bob Alex and Tom Nolan were fine based on their waterfall models
							 ==>Each quarterly meeting planning for next 3-month release:
							 	1) Alex came to Tom's cubicle to discuss all features involved: I always knew because I sat next to Tom
							 		==>During the quarterly meetings: Alex listed all schedules for each feature based on pre-discussions
							 			But also consulted with each assigned engineer with their feedbacks about schedules
							 	2) This included other task items too
			Neutral Examples:
				==>...
			Bad Examples:
				==>Nike:	Provided you a big story: all main tests plus their coverage for one app
							[Jerry]: should break down its entire story into: 
								1) sub-story for each package or section based 
								2) various tasks ...
								==>So it became deliverables for related iterations

Method: Ask Information and Questions:

==>

========================================================
Method: Only Focused on its priorities?


========================================================
Method: Evaluate your current workloads and bandwidths:
	==>Do not accept overloaded workloads...: unless higher priority
	==>Do not engage unreasonable schedules
	==>Do not provide immediate estimates without sufficient information:
			(Then what you should do?
				==>Say: Get back to him/her
				==>Evaluate it now or today, and provide estimates to him/her in the afternoon or in one hour
				==>Ask key questions and define on your own:
					==>Example 1: ask and define:
						==>Sub-Example:
							[Jerry]: What kind of need is this from the business side?
							[Mahesh]: All user's needs are important, that is why MF BTO moves to MF Business
									  Whatever business teams need us to do, we need to take high priority, so does this migration
							[Jerry]:  I don't think this would be so urgent because it is a migration process
									  Can I evaluate it and come up with the estimates today?
							[Mahesh]: Like what I said, all users and business needs are high, this should be done today if possible
							[Jerry]:  I opened the excel, it involves some Java program, so it takes some time to process it
									  And I haven't evaluated the data sets yet, so the data set complexities could contribute to its estimates
									  as well, which I need to check its implementation scenarios, so I would like to get back to you this morning
									  after I review the data sets
							[Mahesh]: Like I said, users needs are important, we should not wait for some evaluations
							[Jerry]:  Based on current review of the file, normally it may need 1-2 weeks to move to production considering data involved
									  and code module required, plus my current workloads, and more importantly based on its criticality of being
									  a data migration instead of incidents or PROD issues
									  Can Vamsi look into it?
							[Mahesh]: Vamsi is not able to look into it due to his new scenario?
							[Jerry]:  Vamsi has joined L3 for several weeks, ...
							[Mahesh]: What do you think when you can get it done?
							[Jerry]:  Like I said above, it should normally take 1-2 week process to move it to PROD
							[Mahesh]: (I am not happy with it, I will report to Sudhir) ...
							[Jerry]:  If unable to provide accurate time to some more evaluations needed, how about we do stage-based processing?
							[Mahesh]: How does it work?
							[Jerry]:  We can work on some stages based updates. I will set up a meeting this afternoon to involve Justin
									  and we discuss the entire scenarios including urgency, justifications, schedules, and estimates, and deliverables
									  (Why did you hire Vamsi if he cannot work on it?
									   [Mahesh]: what did you murmur about?
									   [Jerry]:  Vamsi...
									   [Mahesh]: Vamsi was assigned to L3 due to Robert, he was part of SF Robert's team previously...
									   			 Vamsi was like part of skirt circle of Robert's resources, ...
									   [Jerry]:  He should be able to do some MSS code, which is why he got assigned to MSS and SPARTA replacing Ravinder
									   [Mahesh]: He is not ready, ...
									   [Jerry]:  Can you do coding as well?
									   [Mahesh]: I interact with business groups and users everyday ...
									   [Jerry]:  Recent weeks I have been having business user issues for MFUW, etc. kind of preoccupied, ...
									   			 Can you check with previous Java POC Harish?
									   [Mahesh]: Harish has had some personal scenarios going on while also busy with MFPV etc.
									   [Jerry]:  What personal scenarios?
									   [Mahesh]: Harish is busy with YouTube episodes and films, especially Friday evenings...
									   [Jerry]:  Why did business or Justin told you that this was high priority and their PROD being down 
									   			 if not conducting migration right now considering its being a data migration instead of
									   			 PROD issues?
									   [Mahesh]: Justin could report to MF BTO office (now it is: MF Business Office or BO office) if we don't do this within 2 days
									   [Jerry]:  I really think this is their planning problem instead of our support issues
									   			 I am setting up a meeting this afternoon to streamline these aspects and schedules
									   			 By the way, BO office might be also renamed as: MF BDO Office, or MF DO office, I think)
					==>Example 2: define directly and see how he/she responds:
						==>Sub-Example:
							[Jerry]: this is a migration task, not an incident or a PROD or user issue, so it should not be urgent
							[Mahesh]: it is critical, if we don't do migration today, PROD MSS will be down
							[Jerry]: how come?
							[Mahesh]: Oh, what I meant is: their PROD will be down
							[Jerry]: Then it is their planning issue: if their PROD will be down today, then why didn't they plan it several weeks ago?
							[Mahesh]: This was what Justin told me, and I just repeated what he said and I don't know why
							[Jerry]: Can we arrange a meeting with Justin this afternoon...? From there, we can define its criticality and schedules
									 Even for taking this business requirement into our MSS, we may need to invite Manish/Rahul to the meeting
									 I will set up a meeting for discussing this today.
									 (Then: Jerry set up a meeting to discuss this: before commitment and scheduling it)
							[Mahesh]: Actually I intended to say that if we didn't do it within 2 days, business users will not be happy, ...
							[Jerry]: So our support and schedules are based on their being happy or not instead of business reasons
									 and justifications?
							[Mahesh]: One thing you didn't know is: Justin is MF BDO Office BR Program lead, ..., so
							[Jerry]: This should not be the factor in consideration, and the factors should be the business needs and justifications.
									 Especially consider Justin leaves office at 4pm everyday and ...

		==>Your words: maybe just some possibilities or rough estimates or 
		==>But others:
			1) Could take it seriously or as a promise/commitment
				(Point 1: Change:
					Even commitment could change, but still looks bad...)
				(Point 2: How to change a commitment?
				(Point 3: How to about your words becoming a commitment?
				(Point 4: ...
				==>In normal procedures, this is not a concern 
					because we have scrum meeting, we have OnTrac/JIRA/Collaborator/..., not by words...
			2) Could utilize your words to do unfair things...
			3) 
	==>How to conduct some better communications:
		==>Normal communication needs:
			==>...
		==>Special Communication needs:
			==>Someone talking to you without management's awareness and involvement, or normal work procedures:
				==>Regarding your benefit scenarios: ...
					1) take your credits
					2) use you as a labor for their benefits
					3) delegate extra work or their work items to you
					4) does something non-professionally
					5) 
		==>...
	==>How to deal with:
		==>Pressures
		==>...
		==>Small-Reporting/Bad-Mouthing (out of normal work evaluations, surveys, or team-work, ..., or ranged-performance scenarios, ...)
		==>Intimidation:
			==>If you worry about or start worrying about job-security (could lose your work/job) while you have normal or full workloads already,
				==>This is an example of intimidation..., or at least a manipulation, ..., or unfair treatment, ...
				==>Because at most this could be belonging to performance ranges or variations, not subject to this kind of intimidation
		==>Threats?
