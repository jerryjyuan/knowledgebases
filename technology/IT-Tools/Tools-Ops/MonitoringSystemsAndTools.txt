Tools-Ops: Monitoring Systems and Tools:

Summaries:
	==>Most of the Ops Systems and Tools: are from common industrial vendors/companies/providers: so these knowledge bases could be common
	==>However, each client company could do some customized to select/enable special features in addition to common features: so tools could look differently
	==>Many tools/systems: 
		==>integrated with Service Now:
			==>Monitoring Tools: can triggers alarms and create ServiceNow incident tickets: automatically
		==>integrated with Corporation's Ops Teams (Ops teams are also integrated with Service Now)
	
===========================================
Topic: Systems and Tools

==>Scenario: Server Host Monitoring:
	==>Tool: Spectrum
	==>Tool: Dynatrace Monitoring Tool
	==>
==>Scenario: Monitoring: Server Instance + Application Name
	==>Tool: SiteScope:
			 ==>Managed by SN: can add/remove monitors
			 ==>Node/Monitors
			 ==>How to check?	==>Login to SiteScope: TBD: if disabled: it should show: disabled
	==>
==>Scenario: Monitoring: Server Instance (middleware instances) + port
	==>Tool: Middleware instance alarms
==>Scenario: 
==>
==>

===========================================
Topic: Ownerships:

==>Configured via Service Now: SN also managed teams (groups)
	==>Spectrum/SiteScope and Alarms: GOC (Execution and Monitoring Support + ... + MWS's front-desk)
	==>Middleware Instance Alarms:  Middleware Service Team: MWS/WIO

===========================================
Topic: Routes:
	==>Route 1: Simplest way: 2 minutes
		==>Update existing ticket's field/status
	==>Route 2: Simple way:
		==>Create a ticket: 5 minutes
			==>No Call needed + Automatically processed + No approval needed
	==>Route 3: Medium way:
		==>Create a ticket: 5-30 minutes
			==>Chat/Email needed
			==>Call to execute needed
			==>And/or: Documentation needed
			==>And/or: Approval needed
			==>And/or: Some unknown fields and data to enter
	==>
	
	==>Route 5: Someones tell you... and you behave a puppet first and does it and follow-up with some research/RCA/understanding: during the CHG session
		==>Example 1: Sindhu: told you to close it...
	
	==>Route 6: Need some research and/or some understanding: the second morning 5am in office...


==>Follow-up Routes:
	==>Emails:
		1) ownership groups: respond with some status or emails:
			==>SiteScope: GOC: process it via SiteScope site
			==>Middleware Instances Alarms: WIO: process it via their tool: sometimes they send an email with the screen print as confirmation
		2) SN emails about the task/ticket's info
	==>SN: SN Task pages?: Task: has various info: status: completion: images
		==>SN: can confirm status: it is a REQ and TASK
	==>Login:
		SiteScope
		...

===========================================
Topic: Type 1: CHG

	CHG: create CTASK directly: but not for alarm suppressions: instead use the following ways:

	==>Have more categories than: 1) INC 2) Other normal "Alarm disabling and enabling"
	==>Can automate a lot:
		Create is done via CHG checkbox and info
	==>1) Specify the time window: better:
			==>Guideline 1: Specify window: start-hour to the CHG's backout-end hour (cannot use entire CHG's window: because it could be much longer)
			==>Guideline 1: Double the time window: e.g: if CHG is 3 hours, specify 6 hours
			==>Guideline 3: If doubling time window reaches next day business hour timeline: specify until next business hour timeline
			(Can always create a new ticket to specify a new window for the same CHG: extend its window)
	==>2) CHG: Adjust: Reset/Reschedule:
			==>This applied to CHG: "in scheduled state": means: the suppressions have been enabled in OC/WIO
				==>Then: what happened?
					1) Scenario 1: CHG: reset: to the same schedule (maybe including same weekend or same day...)
					2) Scenario 2: CHG: reset: to the different schedule (different weekend specifically: aka: major changes)
					3) Scenario 3: CHG: cancelled (also: a major change)
				==>Lessons:
					1) CHG: do not easily go to "in scheduled state" - make sure all items are ready for approval:
							==>not rush to "Approval" - avoid "CHG reset... if possible"
					2) CHG: next time working with Justin and Mahesh: we should do better by using Narender or Amar ways: better scheduling and estimates, ...
							==>We should not easily use: emergency CHG or 2-day-work instead of actual-3-4-weeks-L3-developer-work...
							==>Not just some evenings or weekend hours, also wipe out those tickets' shits..., plus ...
			
			==>Scenario 1:			
				==>Process: No need to create a new ticket
					==>If suppression contents no change: No action needed
					==>If suppression contents change:
					(a) Spectrum:
						==>Then: Send an email (with CTASK number) to GOC + Make a call to GOC: notification+processing(or: notification+verification)
					(b) SiteScope:
						==>Then: Send an email (with CTASK number) to GOC + Make a call to GOC: notification+processing(or: notification+verification)
					(c) WIO Middleware Instances Alarm:
						==>Then: Send an email (with CTASK number) to MWS to syncup (if MWS is not responding: contact GOC)
			
			==>Scenario 2 and 3:
				Process: Reset/Cancel: ==>The below tickets can do "overriding" of any other submitted tickets: which enables: "cancelling"
				Create a new ticket: provide reason for the removal of suppression
				(a) Spectrum: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket:
							     ==>Should be: Summary: "Enable Spectrum Monitoring"
				(b) SiteScope: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket:
								==>Should be: Summary: "Enable SiteScope Monitoring"
					==>Then: Send an email (with CTASK number) to GOC + Make a call to GOC: notification+processing(or: notification+verification)
				(c) WIO Middleware Instances Alarm: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket:
								==>Should be: Summary: "Enable Middleware Monitoring"
					==>Then: Send an email (with CTASK number) to MWS to syncup (if MWS is not responding: contact GOC)
								
	==>3) Change: add/adjust/delete (suppression):
			1) Scenarios: Add/Adjust: (Adjust uses similar ways to "Create/Add")
				(TBD: maybe SN doesn't allow "Adjust": only allows: "Add/Delete": ==>RIGHT NOW: Assume: "Adjust" can be done via a new "Add" to override
					  ==>For "Adjust": users may need: 1) Delete+Add: ==>But I don't think so because you cannot cancel (means: delete) an "Add" ticket...)
					  		==>TBD: if an "Add" ticket can be cancelled, then we don't need "Adjust": just do: Cancel+Add-a-new-one
				==============>UPDATES: "adjust" belongs to the above category "Adjust: Reset/Reschedule"
				(a) Spectrum: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: GOC Execution:  (will link to CHG)
						==>Add: create a ticket ==>Adjust: it is a new ticket from "Add" (overriding)
						(IT Services: can do it too (Exection and Monitoring Support group), but not listed as No.1 way)
				(b) SiteScope: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket: No approval needed
								==>Should be: Summary: "Disable SiteScope Monitoring": specify the time window
								==>Add: create a ticket ==>Adjust: it is a new ticket from "Add" (overriding)
				(c) WIO Middleware Instances Alarm: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: "WIO Middleware Instances Alarm Suppression - tickets" (will link to CHG)
						==>Add: create a ticket ==>Adjust: it is a new ticket from "Add" (overriding)
						(IT Services: can do it too, but not listed as No.1 way)
			2) Scenarios: Delete: (similar to the below "finishes early or stopped")
				Spectrum: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket: ==>Specify the time window (add "delete desc" or: specify a past time?) in the description "Maybe No"
				SiteScope: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket: ==>Specify the time window (add "delete desc" or: specify a past time?) in the description? "Maybe No"
								==>Should be: Summary: "Enable SiteScope Monitoring"
				WIO Middleware Instances Alarm: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket: ==>Specify the time window (add "delete desc" or: specify a past time?) in the description? "Maybe No"
								==>Should be: Summary: "Enable Middleware Monitoring"
	==>4) Change finishes early or stopped: create a ticket (5 minutes) (similar to the above "delete")
			1) Too much time left: create a new ticket: specify the finish-time as the end-time: so alarms can be turned on earlier
				Spectrum: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket: ==>Specify the time window (earlier finish time) in the description? ==>"No need"
							     ==>Should be: Summary: "Enable Spectrum Monitoring"
				SiteScope: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket: ==>Specify the time window (earlier finish time) in the description? ==>"No need"
								==>Should be: Summary: "Enable SiteScope Monitoring"
				WIO Middleware Instances Alarm: No approval needed
					==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket: ==>Specify the time window (earlier finish time) in the description? ==>"No need"
								==>Should be: Summary: "Enable Middleware Monitoring"
			2) Just shorter time left: do nothing
	==>3) 
				
===========================================
Topic: Type 2: INC

	INC: create ITASK directly: but not for alarm suppressions: instead use the following ways:

	Delete-Suppression/Enable-Earlier/Etc:
		INC: you can also refer to CHG section if you need to enable monitoring earlier before the specified time window done

==>Spectrum: No approval needed
				==>Ticket 1: GOC Execution  (will link to INC)
==>SiteScope: No approval needed
	==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket: ==>Specify the time window in the description
				==>Summary: "Disable SiteScope Monitoring"	
				(QUESTION: can we create an ITASK to do this? maybe not...)		
==>WIO Middleware Instances Alarm: No approval needed
				==>Ticket 1: "WIO Middleware Instances Alarm Suppression - tickets" (will link to INC)
				(IT Services: can do it too, but not listed as No.1 way)

===========================================
Topic: Type 3: Normal non-CHG and non-INC:

	Examples:
		==>Non-CHG and Non-INC
		==>Others' CHG: but cannot be used for this
		==>Infrastructure weekends: generic scenarios...

	Delete-Suppression/Enable-Earlier/Etc:
		You can also refer to CHG section if you need to enable monitoring earlier before the specified time window done

==>Spectrum: No approval needed
				==>Ticket 1: GOC Execution
==>SiteScope: No approval needed
	==>Ticket 1: IT Services Ticket: ==>Specify the time window in the description
				==>Summary: "Disable SiteScope Monitoring"
