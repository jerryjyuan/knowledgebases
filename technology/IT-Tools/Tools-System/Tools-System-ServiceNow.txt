Tools-System: Service Now:

Summaries:
	==>Service Now: nicknames: SNOW/SN
	==>One of the most important current Ticket/Ops/Task management systems provided by ServiceNow vendor/company:
		==>Many IT companies use it
		==>It means: becoming an expert and summarizing better: useful for many companies/clients IT work: not just TCS-FM client IT work
	==>ServiceNow: pretty powerful:
		==>Many automation items: 
			==>CMDB 
			==>Send out emails 
			==>Linkage of tickets
			==>Create tasks for the ticket types

===========================================
Topic: Service Now: Characteristics:
	==>Ownership: Installed and Managed by company's enterprise team or Service Now team
	==>Portal/Interfaces:
		==>1) Web Portal: Service portal
		==>2) Web Portal: Navigation Dashboard
	==>Each company:
		==>Can configure SN in customized ways: by using common features plus their customized feature sets
		
===========================================
Topic: Ticket Cateogries:
	==>Based on Teams: (SN: teams: called as: Groups)
		Example: IT Services
	==>Based on Functional Types
		Example: General Monitoring
		Example: ...
	==>Based on Functional+Team Types
		Example: GOC Execution - tickets
		Example: WIO Middleware Instances Alarm Suppression - tickets

===========================================
Topic: New to some client-companies or teams/tasks:
	==>Method 1: search SN tickets to gain methods/solutions:
				 ==>
	==>Method 2: ask coworkers...: an example ticket, ..., or a Teams Chat session, or Sharepoint documentation
		==>PROS:
			==>Faster plus some communications/teamwork
			==>
		==>CONS:
			==>Showcasing:
				==>Too new and too lower-level concerns: even just simply asking some questions (yes, indeed, ..., even though it is good to ask questions)
				   (For sure: GMC ways are good: all combined ways...)
			==>Deal with:
				==>Difficult-to-work coworkers...
				==>
			==>Some coworkers:
				==>do not like "documentations or excessive ones"
				==>do not think: "some style documentations are required for their duties", or belong to their roles' duties
					Example: business models and data
					Example: code analysis
					Example: non-official or required documentation
					...
					Example: many so-called documentation items: can be done via: calls/Teams Chat sessions/...

===========================================
Topic: Ticket Roles:

	==>Build/Run Teams:
		==>Walkups

	==>L3 Teams:
		==>Emergency:
			==>Resolve Conflicts: Need to bypass much more items
			==>SIT Test Plan + SIT Approval
			==>UAT Test Plan + UAT Approval
			==>Business GO
			==>Manager Approval - close ticket
		==>Break-Fix
		==>Routine
		==>DCU
		==>RCA
		
	==>Change Manager Team: come to help
		
===========================================
Topic: Ticket Types:

	==>Change CHG:
		==>Almost any main/small change types...: Application + Infrastructure
			==>Teams' scenarios: Application
				==>AppDeployment/Break-fix/DCU/Routine/...
			==>Tools Teams Scenarios: Infrastructure:
				==>Example: Increase/Decrease WebLogic server mem/heap sizes
				==>Example: Add/remove SiteScope monitors
			==>
		==>Scenarios:
			==>CHG: can be planned/created earlier (draft/review: can be stage based to move forward): but not easily moving to "Approval/Scheduled state"
			==>CHG: Updated statuses: can be closed in a few days after status update
			==>
	==>INC:
		==>Aka: incident/"Unexpected Outage"
		==>When to create an incident?
			==>Scenario: the below 2 common routes
			==>Scenario: any scenarios that can be defined as: "outage"
			==>Scenario: any CHG or SN tickets require a prerequisite for the tickets: and mostly it is kind of "outage" as well: 
				Such as: SM has been retired and data are orphaned: it is an outage if no parents taking care of them... except Justin as a guardian and milk-feeder
			==>
		==>Who to create an incident?
			==>Anyone
			==>But common/preferred 2 routes:
				1) MF Service Desk: upon request from BOS/L3/.../users...
				2) Service Now automated ticket creation processes by alarms, etc.
	
	==>REQ:
		==>IT Services ticket
		==>...
		
	==>KBA/KB...
