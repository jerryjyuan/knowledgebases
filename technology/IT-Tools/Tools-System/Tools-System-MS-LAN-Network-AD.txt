Topic: Windows Login/Authentication: Systems:

==>Laptop: Windows:
	==>Windows OS + Windows Accounts
==>Windows: Apps: Authentications:
	==>LAN / Network
	==>AD Group: Windows Security Users: Registry
	==>AD (LDAP mainly): Windows OS: Implementation: LDAP:
		Placing/Storing users into Windows system/LDAP-directories: and enable LDAP to access/manage them
	==>Interaction With AD/LDAP:
		==>MAC
		==>TAM
		==>Keychain:
			==>1) Migrate all TAM security/access groups to keychain access
			==>2) Migrate all


	==>Example Windows Login/Authentication Scenarios:
		==>Users -> Apps' TAM access gateway -> Apps:
			==>TAM Gateways: receive users' access url + user-login-username/pwd: talk to AD/LDAP groups: 
				==>validate/authenticate user login based TAM's groups:
				   1) TAM: external groups: authenticate with AD external groups
				   2) TAM: internal groups: authenticate with AD internal groups
				==>Questions:
				   1) Do TAM groups just authenticate on its own groups info without AD groups?
				   	  ==>[Jerry]:
				   	  		90%: TAM groups are stored in AD groups places: TAM gateway will talk to AD integrated/stored TAM groups?
				   	  			 ==>This is mostly right
				   	  			  ==>Do TAM store the same names' groups in TAM?
				   	  			  ==>Maybe correct: the same named groups are stored in AD as well?
					  		10%: TAM groups manage its own groups - without AD involvement
					  			  ==>Depends: Maybe TAM does its authentications on its own?
					  			  	 ==>No: because logged-in user is for sure needed to be validated for the users' network AD credentials
					  			  	 ==>TAM is doing access control for the apps: and user authentication should go through AD as well
				==>After authentications: TAM delegates the flow to App's Apache/WebLogic servers: added TAM groups in request's headers
			==>TAM migration to Ping:
				==>All TAM groups are moved to Ping PIP (Ping Identify Platform)
				==>Existing users: no actions needed
				==>Procedures:
					==>1) Create all corresponding AD groups to match TAM groups: so TAM groups are on its own before PING?
					==>2) All existing users are added/configured into PIP: so PIP store the same names' groups in PIP?
						  ==>OR: when users login to PING url, its login/usernames are delegated to AD groups for authentication
						  	 and PING doesn't store any same name groups
						  	 ==>Because the AD groups are same names, so existing users can still use the same groups
					==>
		==>Users -> Apps' Ping access gateway -> Apps:
			==>Ping Gateways: receive users' access url + user-login-username/pwd: talk to AD/LDAP groups: 
				==>validate/authenticate user login based AD groups:
				   1) AD: external groups: authenticate with AD external groups
				   2) AD: internal groups: authenticate with AD internal groups
				==>Questions:
				   1) Do Ping groups just authenticate on its own groups info without AD groups?
				   	  ==>[Jerry]:
				   	  		100%: PIP groups are stored in AD groups places: Ping gateway will talk to AD integrated/stored groups
				   	  			  ==>Do PIP store the same names' groups in PIP?
				   	  			  ==>Maybe not: the actual groups are stored in AD
				==>After authentications: PING delegates the flow to App's Apache/WebLogic servers: added AD groups in request's headers
					==>However, the userids are not changed into lower-cases, so whoever logs in as upper-case: got some issues
					   (because the Sybase DB sec_user_bsc uses: lower-case mostly for id_empl field)
		==>Users -> MAC:
			==>MAC is a configuration tool
				1) Configure: AD, TAM, Server, DB, OSSA, etc.
				2) It integrates with various backend systems
				3) All the configurations are saved to corresponding backend systems plus its own configuration management pool/DB
		==>Users -> Keychain:
			==>Keychain is a configuration tool: similar to MAC
				1) Configure: AD, TAM, Server, DB, OSSA, etc.
				2) It integrates with various backend systems
				3) All the configurations are saved to corresponding backend systems plus its own configuration management pool/DB
			==>Keychain: Concepts:
				Application Access: like AD/TAM group access
				Entitlements/Roles
				Application Enrollment
			==>Keychain:
				Can manage more groups than: AD/TAM groups
				Examples:
					==>MFUW's DB users/groups: can be added to Keychain as well

==>Usage:
	==>Usage 1: As a type of SSO
	==>Usage 2: 

==>SSO:
	==>TAM/PING/AD/...

MAC: Modern Access Control

==>Linked to AD groups, and many other backend access systems
==>Menu: "My Access":
	==>Can be viewed and downloaded into Excel/PDF: all the configured access control request/info for this user
==>Feature:
	OSSA: Operational Support System Accounts:
		==>Details: Can be searched and viewed with information

	Approvers:
		==>Can be checked and contact them for approvals

===========================================
RSA: Token:

==>Installed via: Software Center and Software Request
==>RSA Tokens:
	==>Hard Token: a small device
	==>Soft Token: installed as a desktop application above
	

Usage:
	==>Cyberark: MAC Vault:
		==>Similar to Nationwide Randy's MAC Vaulted user/pwd management
		==>Randy: has a UI tool: can directly manage a list of MAC Vault password
		==>Every 3-month, or 180-days: he has a list of password management change needs: Run Team can do the tasks
	==>Procedures:
		==>Cyberark: RSA login
		==>Secure Connection:
			==>Use RSA token again

	==>Application:
		Via Task Manager: right click and select: Maximize (because of "Minimize": The RSA Token App: cannot be seen)
	
	==>Why NP VDI?
		==>A desktop/Window systems for NonProd env
		==>Software Center:
			1) Some common ones: same as normal Laptop
			2) Some NonProd MAC Request ones: if they are for NonProd env
			3) Some special ones: need to be requested via NonPROD MAC requests to be added to: NonPROD NP VDI
				==>RSA Token: NonProd
				==>...
