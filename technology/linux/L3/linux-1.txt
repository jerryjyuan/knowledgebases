RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator.

GNU:
https://www.gnu.org/
The name â€œGNUâ€� is a recursive acronym for â€œGNU's Not Unix.â€� â€œGNUâ€� is pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, like saying â€œgrewâ€� but replacing the r with n.

Short for GNU's Not Unix, GNU (pronounced g'noo) is a free software project to provide a distributable replacement for Unix. GNU was first announced by Richard Stallman on September 27, 1983, and later published in the March 1985 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal.

GNU's goal is to give all computer users the freedom of copying, developing, distributing, modifying, and studying software with the understanding that its redistribution cannot be limited. The goal of the project was achieved in 1992 when Linux was released under the GNU General Public License.

The program in a Unix-like system that allocates machine resources and talks to the hardware is called the â€œkernelâ€�. GNU is typically used with a kernel called Linux. This combination is the GNU/Linux operating system. GNU/Linux is used by millions, though many call it â€œLinuxâ€� by mistake.

GNU's own kernel, The Hurd, was started in 1990 (before Linux was started). Volunteers continue developing the Hurd because it is an interesting technical project.

GNU is an operating system that is free softwareâ€”that is, it respects users' freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom.

We recommend installable versions of GNU (more precisely, GNU/Linux distributions) which are entirely free software.

==>Linux: is GNU/Linux operating system: GNU Unix system using Linux as kernel.
	==>A Unix system (GNU) with Linux kernel
	==>Simplified as Linux System
	==>"installable versions of GNU": using Linux kernel becomes more installable (instead of using GNU's own kernel Hurd)

grep command examples in Linux and Unix
Below is some standard grep command explained with examples to get you started with grep on Linux, macOS, and Unix:

Search any line that contains the word in filename on Linux: grep 'word' filename
Perform a case-insensitive search for the word â€˜barâ€™ in Linux and Unix: grep -i 'bar' file1
Look for all files in the current directory and in all of its subdirectories in Linux for the word â€˜httpdâ€™grep -R 'httpd' .
Search and display the total number of times that the string â€˜nixcraftâ€™ appears in a file named frontpage.md: grep -c 'nixcraft' frontpage.md
How do I list just the names of matching files?
Use the -l option to list file name whose contents mention main():
$ grep -l 'main' *.c
OR
$ grep -Rl 'main' /path/to/project/dir/

	Managed Servers: need to sync up configurations with Admin Servers: so prefer to have a restart after admin server restarts
	
	If Managed Servers are down, maybe don't have to restart Admin Servers when restarting Managed Servers
	
What Happens if the Administration Server Fails?

	The failure of an Administration Server does not affect the operation of Managed Servers in the domain but it does prevent you from changing the domain's configuration. If an Administration Server fails because of a hardware or software failure on its host machine, other server instances on the same machine may be similarly affected. However, the failure of an Administration Server itself does not interrupt the operation of Managed Servers in the domain.

	If an Administration Server for a domain becomes unavailable while the server instances it managesâ€”clustered or otherwiseâ€”are up and running, those Managed Servers continue to run. Periodically, the Managed Servers attempt to reconnect to the Administration Server. If the domain contains clustered server instances, the load balancing and failover capabilities supported by the domain configuration remain available, even if the Administration Server fails.

	You can start a Managed Server even if the Administration Server is not running. In this case, the Managed Server uses a local copy of the domain's configuration files for its starting configuration and then periodically attempts to connect with the Administration Server. When it does connect, it synchronizes its configuration state with that of the Administration Server.

	For information on starting a Managed Server without a running Administration Server, see "Managed Server Independence Mode" in Managing Server Startup and Shutdown for Oracle WebLogic Server. For information on re-starting an Administration Server, see "Avoiding and Recovering From Server Failure" in Managing Server Startup and Shutdown for Oracle WebLogic Server.

Managed Server Independence Mode
	Managed Servers maintain a local copy of the domain configuration. When a Managed Server starts, it contacts its Administration Server to retrieve any changes to the domain configuration that were made since the Managed Server was last shut down. If a Managed Server cannot connect to the Administration Server during startup, it can use its locally cached configuration informationâ€”this is the configuration that was current at the time of the Managed Server's most recent shutdown. A Managed Server that starts up without contacting its Administration Server to check for configuration updates is running in Managed Server Independence (MSI) mode. By default, MSI mode is enabled. For information about disabling MSI mode, see "Disable Managed Server independence" in Oracle WebLogic Server Administration Console Help.	

Managed Servers and the Re-started Administration Server

	If an Administration Server stops running while the Managed Servers in the domain continue to run, each Managed Server periodically attempts to reconnect to the Administration Server, at the interval specified by the ServerMBean attribute AdminReconnectIntervalSeconds. By default, AdminReconnectIntervalSeconds is ten seconds.

	In order for Managed Servers to reconnect after an Administration Server is restarted on a different IP address, you must have:

	Configured a DNS name for the Administration Server URL that maps to multiple IP addresses. For example, a DNS server named wlsadminserver which maps to 10.10.10.1 and 10.10.10.2

	Provided the DNS name for the Administration Server URL when starting the Managed Servers. For example:

	-Dweblogic.management.server=protocol://wlsadminserver:port

	or

	startManagedWebLogic.cmd managed_server_name protocol://wlsadminserver:port

	If the Administration Server goes down, Managed Servers will attempt to reconnect to the Administration Server on all the available URLs. When the Administration Server comes up on any of these URLs, Managed Servers connect to the Administration Server and stop attempting to reconnect on the other URLs. If the Administration Server goes down again, they attempt to reconnect again.

==============================================
ssh:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 -N -f -l username hostname_or_IP

ssh : this starts the SSH client program on your local machine and enables secure connection to the SSH server on a remote computer.
-L 5901:localhost:5901 : states that the local port for the client on the local machine is to be forwarded to the specified host and port of the remote machine. In this case, local port 5901 on the local client is being forwarded to the same port of the given remote server.
-N : instructs to only forward ports, and not to execute a remote command.
-f : sends SSH to background after the password is provided, just before the command is executed. Then, you can freely use the terminal to type commands on the local machine.
-l username : the username you insert here will be used for logging in to the remote server you specified.
hostname_or_IP : this is the remote system with a VNC server. An example of an IP address would be 172.16.0.5 and the example of a hostname would be myserver.somedomain.com.
