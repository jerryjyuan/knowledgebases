DB:

==>DB Systems:
	==>MSSQL:
		Host/Machine/(Unix/Windows Servers) ==>Database Server (instance) (listening on some port: 2044?: default: 2044?) ==>Database Schema: ..., ... ==>Tables: <table>
		(synonyms: Host/Machine/(Unix/Windows Servers) ==>Database Server (instance) (listening on some port: 2044?: default: 2044?): ==>...)
		(server names: lower cases)
		Host: ...
		Database Server Instance: ...
		Database Schema: ...MDB01...
	==>Sybase:
		Host/Machine/(Unix/Windows Servers) ==>Database Server (instance) (listening on some port: 2001/2053: default: 2053) ==>Database Schema: mfs001db, ... ==>Tables: dbo.<table>

		Summaries:
			==>Primary keys: exist: but not a lot: so ... primary keys are not so critical because there are not a lot of auto-incremented id keys like Hibernate ORM, etc.
							 ==>Some primary key(s) are the insert/update date fields
			==>Foreign keys: exist: but not a lot: so some data replications are used + data integrity is enabled/enforced by Java/NET app code + reports + DQ + ...
			=====>Increase data manipulation flexibility due to large volumes of tables 
				==>But some key tables are used as foreign keys + some keys tables are in use as well + some l_xxx tables are used
				==>Masssive table joins are in use ==>Without extensive foreign keys, it eases the join conditions plus multiple data query variations can be used
				==>Data quality can be assured via multiple ways instead of foreign keys as the main ways
			==>AutoSys Jobs are used to do data transfer and migrations as some main ways in addition to SOA API services
	==>Oracle:
		==>Oracle OEM's default/own configuration/local DB servers: default port: 1521
	==>DB2:
		==>TAM Server's default/own configuration/local DB servers
	==>WebLogic Servers:
		==>Support many DB and JDBC drivers (prefer to use their default JDBC drivers if available, so not easily choose: "Other" from dropdown list)
		==>DS: created and added to both AServer and MServers: why not? because both servers can use/share this DS, it is for sure good, and nothing wrong: commonly just add to both
	==>Glassfish Servers:
		TBD
	==>OC4J Server/Containers:
		TBD
==>data fields: lower cases:	c50276 instead of C50276
