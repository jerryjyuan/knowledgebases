	Similar to ReactJS, but many differences:
		The main difference between Vue. js and React is that Vue. js uses templates with declarative rendering (xxx.vue files)
		while React uses JSX, which is a pretty much a JS extension that allows using HTML within it (render()...). 
		That means React requires more complex implementations for even simple tasks(comparing to Vue).
		
		JavaScript XML
			JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
