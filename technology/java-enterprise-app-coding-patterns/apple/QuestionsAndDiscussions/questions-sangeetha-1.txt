[2021-05-18]:
	==>[Jerry]: Github/SSH-key
		==>This was a small error and question
		Jerry: should have just added the SSH key regardless of ...: it is the same as normal Github and other companies' github
			   even google protobuf is using github, ...
			   Github:
			   		1) a repository hub / vendor for storing git repos and codebases
			   		2) provide github desktop and web portal clients, and also SSH/HTTPS clone
			   		3) every company: create/maintain their repos in github: will secure it: via 2+ ways:
			   			==>Way 1: One of the main ways is: SSH keys
			   				==>SSH keys: configured in profile: can add multiple SSH keys: public keys
			   					1) So multiple ones having their private keys on their parts: can access to it
			   					2) Also from multiple platforms...
			   			==>Way 2: GPG
			   			==>...
			   		4) every account/personal: do the same, ..., my github added with my SSH keys?
			   			==>NO: because I am only using HTTPS and also web portal ==>I am not using SSH
			   				1) IDE: I am using https
			   					==>IDE: can use SSH as well: but needs ssh keys
			   					==>IDE: can locate user's private key from .ssh automatically: TO see why...
			   						1) user directory...
			   						2) or configured via IDE's secure store...
			   				2) Web: I am using web portal
			   				3) Linux/Laptop/AnyGitClients: I am not using ssh to sync up with Github to do clone, etc.
			   					Linux: ssh: needs SSH keys as well
			   						==>But company env:
			   							Server1->Server2: ssh he1alxvpmid1023: where is private key? in user home .ssh?
			   								Or: automatically configured?
			   					Github/SSH: configured by public/private key method
			   				4) ...
		Counteracting and fixing this small error:
			==>Forward one of my email reply to Sangeetha...
