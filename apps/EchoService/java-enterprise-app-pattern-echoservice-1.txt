	Spring Rest Docs:
		==>Compared with Spring Fox Swagger UI and REST docs
			https://dzone.com/articles/spring-rest-docs-versus-springfox-swagger-for-api
			1) By default, Spring REST Docs uses Asciidoctor. Asciidoctor processes plain text and produces HTML, styled and laid out to suit your needs. If you prefer, Spring REST Docs can also be configured to use Markdown. This really distinguished it from Swagger, which uses its own notation called OpenAPI Specification.
			2) Spring REST Docs makes use of snippets that are produced by tests written with Spring MVC’s test framework, Spring WebFlux’s WebTestClient or REST Assured 3.
		asciidocs
		1) .asciidocs: .adoc files
			src/docs/ascidosc/*.adoc
		2) snippet files:
			target/generated-snippets
		3) generated docs files:
			targte/generated-docs
				index.adoc => index.html

			==>Add a plugin: asciidoctor-maven-plugin
